<h2>I.<br />
THE OUTBREAK.</h2>


<p>In jotting down the reminiscences and
sketches contained in the following
pages, my aim is to record simply and
truthfully certain episodes of a stirring
period of Indian military history.</p>

<p>Englishmen can never cease to be interested
in the story of the great Sepoy
Mutiny; and I trust that even so modest a
contribution as mine to the narrative of
some of its details may not be considered
superfluous. Often have I been urged
to give the semi-permanence of printer's
ink to some story told over the walnuts
and the wine; and at last I am tempted
to take advantage of the enforced leisure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which has been imposed on me by the
recent regulations limiting tenure of regimental
command, and placing me,
with many other better men, unwillingly
<i>en retraite</i>, while still in the prime of life
and energy.</p>

<p>If I am compelled, in the course of
these pages, to speak of myself and my
own doings, I trust that I may be absolved
from the imputation of being prompted
by vainglorious motives; and that my
excuse may be found in the evident
impossibility of keeping the first personal
pronoun out of a personal narrative.
My having been mixed up in
the events which I propose to describe
is clearly an accident for which, though
I may apologise, I am not responsible;
and perhaps if I had not been engaged
in them I should have known a good
deal less about them. Whether that is
an advantage, or the reverse, to a
<i>raconteur</i>, is, of course, a matter of opinion.
Certainly, a witness is much less
hampered in his statements if he is not
limited and bound down by the fact of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
his having been actually present at the
scenes described in his evidence. His
imaginative faculties are thereby quickened
and enriched.</p>

<p>Hitherto, though often sorely tempted,
I have refrained from publishing any
account of those details of events during
the Mutiny at which I was myself present;
for, as will be seen, these details
involve certain corrections in narratives
which have been, for want of fuller information,
accepted as complete. While
perfectly true, in most points, so far as
they have gone, they yet suffer from
omissions which I am able to supply.
The accuracy of my rectifications is, fortunately,
capable of ample proof, since
several very distinguished officers still
survive who can vouch for it; and in
most instances I am also in possession
of conclusive contemporary documentary
evidence.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to inflict on the
reader my own views as to the origin of
the Mutiny. Whether the <i>fons et origo
mali</i> was deep-seated and of slow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
growth&mdash;whether it was due to political
discontent at the overthrow of the great
Mogal Empire, the annexation of Oudh,
and the reduction of the King of
Delhi to the position of a puppet of John
Company Bahadur&mdash;or whether it arose
simply from the excessive and pampered
growth of the sepoy army, which, like
the ass Jeshuron, waxed fat and kicked,
is a question which has been often dealt
with by abler pens than mine. It is,
however, a significant fact that many
clear-sighted men had, from time to time,
issued notes of warning as to the likelihood
of such a catastrophe.</p>

<p>When at length the threatened storm
burst, my regiment, the late 3rd Bengal
Light Cavalry, was one of those which
broke into revolt at Meerut. In its ranks
were ninety men armed with muzzle-loading
carbines; and it was these carabineers
who first set authority at defiance
by refusing to use the cartridges supplied
to them, on the ground that they suspected
the grease used in lubricating them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
have been composed of hog's lard. This
pretext was, on the face of it, absurd;
since, as a matter of fact, the cartridges
had been made regimentally; and all
the men perfectly well knew that so
innocent a compound as bees' wax and
clarified butter had been applied as a
lubricant. The word had, however, been
passed throughout the Bengal native
army to make the cartridge question the
test as to which was stronger&mdash;the native
soldier or the Government. Every
one remembers the mysterious "chuppatties"
or flat wheaten cakes which, shortly
before the Mutiny, were circulated
from regiment to regiment. The message
conveyed by them has never been
fathomed by Englishmen; but there can
be no doubt that they were in some way
a signal, understood by the sepoys, of
warning to be in readiness for coming
events.</p>

<p>Colonel Carmichael Smith, Commanding
the 3rd Light Cavalry, with a view
to test the willingness or otherwise of
the carabineers of his regiment to use the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
cartridges, held a special parade for the
purpose on the 24th of April 1857; and,
after an explanatory speech, pointing
out to the men the groundlessness of
their fears, ordered them to use the cartridges.
Eighty-five of them refused to
do so. A court of inquiry was subsequently
held on their conduct, followed
by the inevitable court-martial. Only
one finding was possible; and the sentence
pronounced on all the culprits was
one of ten years' imprisonment. This,
in the case of some of the younger soldiers,
was reduced to five years by the
confirming officer, General Hewett, Commanding
the Meerut Division. On the
morning of the 9th of May the whole
garrison of Meerut paraded to hear the
sentences read out; after which each
convict was fitted with a pair of leg-irons,
fitted there and then, on to his ankles by
blacksmiths.</p>

<p>In sullen silence the two native infantry
corps, the 11th and 20th, and my own
regiment, which was dismounted on that
occasion, witnessed the degrading punishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
It would have been madness for
them then to have attempted a rescue;
for they would have been swept off the
face of the earth by the guns of the
artillery and the rifles of Her Majesty's
60th Foot, not to speak of the swords of
the 6th Dragoon Guards, the Carabineers,
all of whom were provided with service
ammunition, and were so placed as to have
the native regiments at their mercy.</p>

<p>For more than an hour the troops
stood motionless, their nerves at the
highest tension, while the felon shackles
were being methodically and of necessity
slowly hammered on the ankles of the
wretched criminals, each in turn loudly
calling on his comrades for help, and
abusing, in fierce language, now their
Colonel, now the officers who composed
the court-martial, now the Government.
No response came from the ranks. The
impressive ceremony was duly finished.
The prisoners were taken charge of by
the authorities of the jail and a guard of
native infantry; and the troops marched
back to quarters. For a few hours all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was quiet. The snake of insubordination
was, to all appearance, scotched, if
not killed. Every one hoped that the
stern lesson had been effectual; but a
rough disillusion was in store for us.</p>

<p>On the evening of the next day, the
memorable Sunday, 10th of May 1857, at
the hour when better folk were on their
way to church, I was quietly reading a
book in my own bungalow when my
bearer Sheodeen suddenly rushed into
the room, exclaiming that a <i>hulla-goolla</i>
(in our vernacular, a riot) was going on
in the lines, that the sepoys had risen,
and were murdering the <i>Sahib logue</i>.
Not for an instant did I believe the latter
part of his story, even though the rapid
and frequent reports of fire-arms, which
now broke the quiet of the Sabbath evening,
made only too clear the truth of the
first. The thought that flashed through
my mind was that our men of the cavalry
were attacking the native infantry in
revenge for the sneers with which we all
knew these others had freely, since the
punishment parade, lashed their submissive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
apathy in witnessing, without an
attempt at rescue, the degradation of
their comrades. Sooth to say&mdash;so strong
is the tie of <i>camaraderie</i>&mdash;my sympathies
were all in the wrong direction; and I
would secretly have rejoiced to have seen
the insult avenged. Hurriedly putting
on my uniform and sword, I jumped
on a horse, and galloped towards the
regimental lines; but I had scarcely
got out of the gate of my compound
when I met the English Quartermaster-Sergeant
of my regiment flying for his
life on foot from his house in the
lines.</p>

<p>"Oh God! Sir," he exclaimed, "the
troopers are coming to cut us up." "Let
us then stick together," I answered;
"two are better than one." For a moment
he hesitated. Then, looking back, the
sight of a small cloud of dust rapidly
approaching from the distance overcame
his resolution, and he rushed through the
gate into the grounds of my bungalow,
and scaled the wall between them and
those of the next house. Instantly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
small mob of <i>budmashes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> prominent
among whom I recognised my own night
watchman, attacked him. The chowkidar
thrust at him with his spear as he
was crossing the wall, and cut open his
lips. To my joy he fired one barrel of a
gun which he carried with him, and shot
the brute dead. He then dropped on to
the ground on the other side, and disappeared
from view. Later on will be
found his subsequent adventures: for I
rejoice to say he escaped with his life.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<p>At this moment an infantry sepoy,
armed with a sword, made a sudden
swoop with it at my head. I had not
drawn my sword, and had only time to
dig a spur into my horse's flank and force
him almost on to my enemy. This spoilt
his stroke, and his tulwar fortunately
missed its aim, and only cut my right
shoulder cord. By this time I had pulled
my weapon out of its scabbard, but
the sepoy declined any further sword-play,
and promptly climbed over a wall
out of my reach. As I turned from him
and looked down the road to the lines, I
saw that it was full of cavalry troopers galloping
towards me. Even then it did not
occur to me that they could have any hostile
intent towards myself. I shouted to
them to halt. This they did, and surrounded
me; and, before I knew what
was happening, I found myself warding
off, as well as I could, a fierce onslaught
from many blades. A few moments
would have sealed my fate, when, providentially,
the late Lieutenant Craigie
emerged from his gate a little further
down the road and came straight to my
help. This diversion saved me. The
troopers scattered past us and made off
towards the European lines. It was only
too clear now that a mutiny, and that of
the most serious kind, was in full swing.
Our duty was plain, though very hard to
perform, for at this moment Lieutenant
Craigie's Wife and my Sister were on
their way together in his carriage to the
church, situated in the European lines,
and our first natural impulse was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
gallop after them. But they had started
some little time previously, and we hoped
that they had already reached their destination,
and were in safety among the
British troops. Military discipline sometimes
tries a soldier to the utmost; and
now we felt that Wife and Sister must
be left in the hands of God, and that our
place was among the mutineers on the
parade-ground. Thither we went as fast
as our horses could carry us, and found
ourselves in a scene of the utmost uproar.
Most of the men were already mounted,
and were careering wildly about, shouting
and brandishing their swords, firing
carbines and pistols into the air, or forming
themselves into excited groups.
Others were hurriedly saddling their
horses and joining their comrades in hot
haste.</p>

<p>Nearly every British officer of the Regiment
came to the ground, and used
every effort of entreaty, and even menace,
to restore order, but utterly without effect.
To their credit be it said the men did not
attack us, but warned us to be off, shouting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that the Company's Raj was over for
ever! Some even seemed to hesitate
about joining the noisiest mutineers; and
Craigie, observing this, was led to hope
that they might be won over to our side.
He was an excellent linguist and had
great influence among them, and he
eventually managed to get some forty or
fifty troopers to listen to him and keep
apart in a group. Suddenly a rumour
reached us that the jail was being attacked
and the prisoners released. Calling
to the late Lieutenant Melville Clarke
and myself to come with him, Craigie
persuaded the group which he had assembled
to follow him, and away we went
towards the jail. The roads were full of
excited natives who actually roared approbation
as we rode through them, for
they evidently did not distinguish in the
dusk the British officers, and took the
whole party for a band of mutineers. We
three officers led, and as we neared the
jail our pace increased, till from a smart
trot we broke into a gallop. Already the
sepoys and the mob had begun their destructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
work. Clouds of smoke on all
sides marked where houses had been set
on fire. The telegraph lines were cut, and
a slack wire, which I did not see as it
swung across the road, caught me full on
the chest, and bowled me over into the
dust. Over my prostrate body poured
the whole column of our followers, and I
well remember my feelings as I looked
up at the shining hoofs. Fortunately I
was not hurt, and regaining my horse I
remounted, and soon nearly overtook
Craigie and Clarke, when I was horror-struck
to see a palanquin gharry&mdash;a sort
of box-shaped venetian-sided carriage&mdash;being
dragged slowly onwards by its
driverless horse, while beside it rode a
trooper of the 3rd Cavalry, plunging his
sword repeatedly through the open window
into the body of its already dead
occupant&mdash;an unfortunate European woman.
But Nemesis was upon the murderer.
In a moment Craigie had dealt
him a swinging cut across the back of
the neck, and Clarke had run him through
the body. The wretch fell dead&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
first sepoy victim at Meerut to the sword
of the avenger of blood. All this passed
in a second, and it was out of the power
of our men to prevent it; but the fate of
their comrade evidently greatly excited
and angered them. Shouts of "<i>maro!
maro!</i>" ("kill! kill!") began to be heard
among them, and we all thought the end
was approaching. However, none of
the men attacked us, and in a few minutes
we reached the jail, only to find that we
were too late. The prisoners were already
swarming out of it; their shackles were
being knocked off by blacksmiths before
our eyes; and the jail-guard of native
infantry on our riding up to it answered
our questions by firing at us, fortunately
without hitting any of us. There was
nothing to be done but to ride back to
the cantonment.</p>

<p>No sooner had we turned our horses'
heads than the full horror of what was
taking place burst upon us. The whole
cantonments seemed one mass of flames.
If before we rode fast, now we flew; for
the most urgent fears for the safety of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
those dear to us tortured us almost to
madness. As we tore along Craigie allowed
me to leave him and go in search
of his Wife and my Sister, and to take
any of the men who would go with me.
I lifted my sword and shouted for volunteers
to come to save my Sister, and some
dozen of them galloped after me. As hard
as our horses could gallop we tore along.
Every house we passed was in flames,
my own included, and my heart sank
within me. Craigie's house alone was
not burning when we reached it&mdash;a large
double-storeyed building, in very extensive
grounds, surrounded, as was then
usual, by a mud wall. Here I found
Mrs. Craigie and my Sister. They had
never reached the church. Their coachman
had turned back in terror of the
mob. As they passed the bazar a soldier
of the 6th Dragoon Guards rushed out of
a bye-lane, pursued by a yelling crowd.
The brave ladies, at the imminent risk of
their own lives, stopped the carriage,
took him in and drove off at full speed,
followed for some distance by the blood-thirsty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
wretches who, being on foot, were
soon left behind, not, however, till they
had slashed with their tulwars in several
places the hood of the carriage, in vain
efforts to reach the inmates.</p>

<p>It is impossible to realise what terrors
these ladies must have suffered till the
moment of my arrival. Every minute
they despaired of surviving to the next.
All round them flames of burning houses
and mobs of yelling demons! Not knowing
whether the Husband and Brother
were alive or dead&mdash;deserted apparently
by God and man&mdash;hopeless of help,&mdash;they
yet never despaired, nor lost their courage
or presence of mind. Their first
thought had been to find Craigie's weapons
and place them where they would
be ready to hand if he or I did ever come.
Nothing had they overlooked. Three
double-barrelled guns stood against the
wall, with powder-flask and bullets and
caps. They were not loaded, for the
ladies did not know how to load them;
and the unfortunate Carabineer was in a
state of nervous collapse. Overjoyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and thankful to Providence as I was to
find them still alive and unhurt, I could
not conceal from them that extreme danger
was by no means over, and that they
would yet have need of all their courage.
The greatest risk I instinctively felt was
from the uncertain temper of my men;
and I determined on a desperate stroke.
I therefore brought the ladies down to the
door of the house, and calling to me the
troopers commended their lives to their
charge. It is impossible to understand
the swift torrents of feeling that flood the
hearts of Orientals in periods of intense
excitement. Like madmen they threw
themselves off their horses and prostrated
themselves before the ladies, seizing
their feet and placing them on their
heads, as they vowed with tears and sobs
to protect their lives with their own.</p>

<p>Greatly re-assured by this burst of evidently
genuine emotion, I now ordered
the men to mount and patrol the grounds,
while I took the ladies upstairs, and then
loaded all the guns with ball. One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
them I placed by itself against the wall.
Long afterwards, in quiet England, my
Sister, who still survives, told me that
both she and Mrs. Craigie well understood
the sacred use to which that gun
was, in the last resort, devoted, and that
the knowledge comforted and strengthened
them.</p>

<p>Through the windows flashed brilliant
light from the flaming houses on all sides.
The hiss and crackle of the burning timbers&mdash;the
yells of the mob&mdash;the frequent
sharp reports of fire-arms&mdash;all formed a
confused roar of sound, the horror of
which might well have overpowered the
nerves of the ladies; but I learned during
that awful night the quiet heroism of
which our gentle countrywomen are capable
in the hour of need. As I stepped
out on to the upper verandah I was seen
by some of the mob who were wrecking
the opposite house. "There is a feringi,"
they cried; "let us burn this big <i>kothi</i>"
(house), and several of them ran forward
with lighted brands to the boundary wall;
but on seeing my gun levelled at them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
they thought better of it and recoiled.
More than once this happened. It seemed
only a matter of time before our house
should be set on fire at one point or
another. Fortunately I remembered the
existence in the grounds of a small Hindu
shrine, strongly built of masonry, on a
high plinth, and with only one entrance,
approached by a flight of stone or brick
steps. If I could only get my charges
and the guns and ammunition safely
across the open space between us and
that building, I felt sure of being able to
hold out till help should come: for surely
help would soon come! Were not the
6th Dragoon Guards, the 60th Rifles,
and the Horse Artillery Batteries within
a couple of miles?</p>

<p>At this juncture we were cheered by
the arrival of Lieutenant Craigie, who,
after I left him, had gone back to the
parade-ground where the uproar was
still at its height, the heroic efforts of the
British officers to bring the men to
reason being quite futile. At length,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
seeing the hopelessness of further endeavour,
and finding the men getting
more and more uncontrollable, they were
compelled to retire and make for the
European lines, carrying away with them
the now for-ever disgraced standards of
the regiment. One of them, the late Major
Fairlie, also carried with him a bullet
which was lodged in his saddle-tree.
Craigie then made his way back to us at
great risk of his life, accompanied by a
few men who had never left him. He
warmly approved of my plan; and, having
explained it to the ladies, they
quickly gathered together a few necessary
articles of apparel, &amp;c.; and each
carrying her bundle, and concealed as
far as possible under a covering of dark
blanket, while Craigie and the Carabineer
and I carried the guns and ammunition,
we seized a favourable moment
and ran rapidly across to our new
stronghold.</p>

<p>Once there, we were safe from being
burnt out, and indeed from successful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
attack of any kind by the cowardly crew
with which we had to deal. The interior
space was very small, probably about ten
feet square. In front was the narrow
doorway; and in the massive walls were
slits like loopholes through which we
could observe if any attempts were made
to approach the place. Every now and
then our troopers brought us news of
what was going on. The night had not
long closed in when they told us that
apparently the whole body of mutineers,
horse and foot, had marched away to
Delhi. Their attack on the European
lines, if they had made one, had clearly
failed; and the only marauders remaining
in Meerut were the butchers and other
scum of the city and bazars. Presently
one of our men went over to the opposite
house, which by this time was burnt
nearly to the ground. He returned with
awful news. He had found the dead
body of its occupant, a lady, whose husband
at the outbreak of the mutiny was
absent in the European quarter. She
had been most cruelly and brutally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
murdered, her unborn infant sharing her
pitiable fate. He showed us, in confirmation
of his story, a portion of her dress
reeking with blood. Not far from us, another
lady, while attempting to escape,
disguised as an ayah, was recognised
as a European, and murdered. Two
veterinary-surgeons, attached to the regiment,
had been killed&mdash;one of them
with his wife&mdash;under circumstances of
ghastly horror. They were both sick
in bed with small-pox when the uproar
of the mob startled them; and they
came, in their night clothes, into the verandah,
he carrying a gun loaded with
shot, which he discharged at the crowd,
only further enraging it. He was instantly
shot dead. His wife met with a
worse fate. The cowardly demons, afraid
to touch her because of the danger of infection,
threw lighted brands at her. Her
dress caught fire; and she perished thus
miserably. My own house-comrade, a
fine young officer, had been mobbed on
his way to church, and so hacked to
pieces that but for his length&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
very tall&mdash;and the rags of his uniform
which still clung to him, his remains would
have been unrecognisable when they
were subsequently recovered. A poor
little girl, daughter of one of the British
Non-Commissioned Officers of the regiment,
had been slaughtered by a blow of a
sword which cut her skull in two. Scenes
like the above had been enacted all over
Meerut; but I will spare the reader further
details. If he is sickened by what
I have already written, I can only say
that mere generalities, however graphic,
are insufficient to place before him a true
picture of what English men, women, and
children suffered at the hands of the mutineers,
not only in Meerut, but almost
everywhere through the North-West of
India.</p>

<p>In these days of agitation for the repeal
of the Arms Act, it is well to remind
home-staying Englishmen of what once
occurred, and what may again occur if
a wave of political discontent or religious
fanaticism should unhappily once
more sweep over the "land of regrets."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Anxiously did we now listen for the
rattle of horses' hoofs, the rumble of
guns, or the tramp of feet coming to
our help&mdash;but none came! Hour after
hour passed&mdash;and still the mob were
left undisturbed in their work of destruction
and murder. We heard afterwards
that a strong mounted party
had been sent to clear the cantonments
and rescue any survivors of the massacre;
but&mdash;incredible to relate&mdash;it had
been misled by the Staff Officer who was
detailed to guide it, and never reached
its intended destination. Among the
troopers with us were one or two traitors,
whose sole object in remaining was to
undermine the loyalty of the rest. A
young recruit who had, not long previously,
passed through riding school in the
same squad with myself, presently came
to me as I was standing among a group
of the men outside our stronghold (for
Craigie and I now took it in turns to try
and re-assure them by mixing with them),
and warned me to be beware of the Havildar-Major,
who had, he said, at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
moment, been urging the others to kill
me. It may be well imagined that I took
very good care afterwards to keep a
watchful eye on that Non-Commissioned
Officer, and to let him see by a touch
of my hand on the hilt of my sword that
I was quite ready for any suspicious
movement on his part. Soon afterwards
he and a few others rode out of the gate,
and we saw them no more. They had
not long gone when a servant of Craigie's,
a Hindu bearer, came up to us in
great excitement with the news that a
crowd of <i>budmashes</i> was coming in at
the gate. He implored us to give him
one of the guns, and let him go and fire
at them. Whether wisely or not, we did
so; and almost immediately afterwards
we heard a report, followed by yells and
groans. In a few moments the bearer
returned, and gave us back the gun,
saying that he had fired into "the brown"
of the advancing mob, and brought one
of them down, and the rest had fled.</p>

<p>It was now about midnight. The uproar
was quieting down; and we determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
on making our escape, if possible.
So, with our own hands&mdash;the <i>syces</i>
(grooms) having bolted&mdash;we harnessed
Craigie's horses to his carriage; placed
the ladies and the Carabineer inside
with the three guns; made a native boy
who usually rode postillion, and who
fortunately had not gone off with the
syces, mount one of the horses and set
off, Craigie and I riding with drawn
swords beside the carriage. This was
a critical moment. A knot of the troopers,
evidently wavering in their intentions,
occupied the avenue before us, loudly
talking and gesticulating. The postillion
hesitated; but, on our threatening
to run him through the body if he did
not at once gallop on, he took heart of
grace, lashed his horses, and in a moment
we had charged through and scattered
the impeding group, and were racing
along the avenue at full speed over
the body of the man who had been killed
by the faithful bearer, and who was afterwards
identified as a Musalman butcher,
a class of men who were among the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
blood-thirsty actors on that night. Turning
out of the gate to our left we made
along the road to the regimental parade-ground,
from which a nearly unbroken
plain stretched to the European lines.
We found the plain deserted; and rapidly
made our way till we reached a short
length of straight road which ran to the
stables of the Carabineers. At the far
end of it we saw a light, which we rightly
took to be a portfire. Making the
postillion slacken speed, Craigie and I
galloped forward, shouting "Friend!
Friend!" at the utmost stretch of our
lungs; and well was it we did so; for we
found at a point where a bridge crossed a
nullah a piquet with a gun trailed
up the road; and the subaltern in command
told us he was on the point of firing
at our rapidly approaching group when
our voices reached him. At last&mdash;with
deep gratitude&mdash;we felt that our dear
ones were once more safe among our own
countrymen. The wife of a Sergeant of
the Carabineers very kindly gave the
ladies shelter for the rest of the night;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
and Craigie and I shifted for ourselves,
<i>al fresco</i>.</p>

<p>To revert to the adventures of the
regimental Quartermaster-Sergeant after
he left me. Covered with blood from
the wound in his lip and carrying his
gun in one hand and his sword in the
other, he presented a sufficiently startling
spectacle as he burst into a room of
a neighbouring bungalow occupied by
two young officers, and warned them&mdash;still
unconscious&mdash;of what was taking
place. Not a moment did they lose in
buckling on their swords and rushing to
the stables. As they did so they saw
one of their own syces running away
with a saddle on his head. They could
only find two other saddles; but fortunately
bridles for three horses were hanging
on their usual pegs. Rapidly slipping
them on, they mounted, giving the
Sergeant a bare-backed animal, and they
made for a gate. It was blocked by mutineers.
They turned to the other: that
also was blocked. Their lives seemed
lost, when one of their servants, a sweeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
the lowest and most despised caste
of Indian domestics, heedless of the certainty
that his own life would be sacrificed
to the fury of the mob disappointed
of its prey, implored them to follow
him. Running before them he led them
to the back of the out-houses, and showed
them a gap in the "compound"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> wall
which the servants had made for their
own convenience. Through this gap
they filed, and galloped off, escaping the
hurried shots which were fired after
them, and eventually reaching in safety
the barracks of the 60th Rifles. The
sweeper fell a victim to the rage of the
pursuers. He was hacked to pieces.
No more beautiful deed ever brightened
the dark days of the "'57" than the
self-sacrifice of this obscure and nameless
hero.</p>

<h2>II.<br />
SKIRMISHING.</h2>


<p>Before continuing my narrative, I
wish to draw particular attention to a
circumstance which, so far as I know,
has been overlooked by every historian
of the Mutiny. This is the fact that
as I was at the time informed, the military
authorities, in view of the lengthening
days and the increasing heat of the
season, had caused, on May 10th, 1857,
the evening church parade to take place
half an hour later than formerly. In my
firm belief, this change saved us from an
awful catastrophe. In those days British
troops attended divine service
practically unarmed, for they did not
take with them their rifles or carbines
and ammunition. Their only weapons
were their side-arms. The mutineers
were, of course, unaware of this change.
They broke into revolt half an hour too
soon. Had they waited till the 60th
Rifles were securely gathered into the
church, what could have prevented them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from overpowering the small guards
over the rifles and the guns, and utterly
destroying the defenceless crowd of
soldiers penned, like sheep, within four
walls. Providence befriended us. When
the first scouts of the cavalry came galloping
down to the European lines,
they found the white soldiers falling into
their places on parade. Once the alarm
was given, all attempt at surprise was
out of the question, and the hope of
achieving an easy massacre was changed
into fear of the awful retribution which
they thought the European troops, now
on the alert, would not fail speedily to
exact. This fear altered all their plans,
and hastened their flight to Delhi, so
graphically described by Sir John Kaye;
but, alas! no swift retribution followed.</p>

<p>The European troops, 1,500 strong,
were paralysed by the irresolution of
their chief. Had the gallant Hearsey
or Sidney Cotton occupied Hewett's
place at Meerut, it is safe to say
that, in spite of the wings which fear
lent to the mutineers on their flight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Delhi, few of them would ever have
reached that haven of their hopes. The
shrapnel of the artillery and the swords
of the Carabineers would have annihilated
them. It is true that Generals Hewett
and Archdale Wilson, late in the evening,
moved the troops over the open
plain of the infantry parade-ground and
that they caused a few rounds to be fired,
in the dark, at some belated stragglers of
the cavalry, which said rounds, by the
way, nearly killed an officer, Lieutenant
Galloway, of my regiment, who had taken
refuge in an out-house in the line of fire;
but General Hewett, instead of even then
detaching the Carabineers and a battery
of horse artillery in pursuit of the flying
mutineers, acted on the ill-starred advice
of his Brigadier to withdraw the whole
force to the European lines. No greater
mistake from any point of view was ever
committed.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the offer
of Captain Rosser, of the 6th Dragoon
Guards, to take a squadron and a couple
of guns in pursuit, was really made and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
declined; for it was well known and
much discussed at the time. It is true
that intimation of this offer never reached
the Colonel Commanding the Regiment;
but it is equally certain that somebody
blundered in not taking immediate steps
to bring it to the notice of Colonel Custance.
The prompt punishment which
even such a small body could have inflicted
would have been of the utmost
value as a lesson both to the rebels and
to the faint-hearted among ourselves;
but the opportunity was wilfully thrown
away; and the magnificent brigade of
British troops of all arms, which afterwards
covered itself with glory at the
Hindun Nuddee, at Delhi, at Lucknow,
and wherever its members met the enemy,
was marched back to Meerut, and condemned
for a period to the humiliating
<i>rôle</i> of passive inaction.</p>

<p>Difficult as it is to understand, and
impossible to excuse the motives which
paralysed the nerves of General Hewett,
it can only be hoped that all our
officers have laid to heart the lesson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
so frequently learned in the great
school of the Sepoy Mutiny that, in dealing
with an Oriental enemy, <i>l'audace!
et toujours l'audace</i> is not only the most
soldierlike but the surest road to success.
"Strike promptly and strike hard"
should be their motto. Over and over
again have small bodies of Englishmen,
under the most desperate circumstances,
and against the most fearful odds, by
acting on this maxim, "plucked the
flower safely from the nettle danger."
When the day comes, as come it will,
that we Englishmen will once more have
to fight for the preservation of our Indian
Empire, the issue will only be doubtful
if timid and irresolute counsels prevent
us from putting forth the whole of our
strength at the first serious symptoms of
internal disaffection or external menace.</p>

<p>During the next few days the Meerut
garrison lay inert. Far from undertaking
any distant reconnaisances or making
any active efforts to restore to quiet the
surrounding districts, not even was punishment
inflicted on the city or the bazars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
which had poured forth their swarms of
murderers and robbers on the night of
the 10th. A few individual marauders
were, it is true, caught and hanged; but
there retributive measures ceased. Native
houses, choked with plunder, were left
unsearched, and their occupants were
allowed unmolested to swagger about in
the sight of all men, and to boast among
themselves of the shame and havoc they
had wrought on the "Feringhi."</p>

<p>Our women and children and unarmed
civilian refugees were given shelter in
the "Dumdama," an often-described
walled enclosure. The Generals and
their staffs and many other officers took
refuge in a barrack, over which a guard
was duly mounted. Piquets, inlying
and outlying, were told off; and every
precaution was taken to prevent the cantonments
being rushed by the "budmashes"
of the "Burra Bazar" or the
Goojars of the neighbouring villages!</p>

<p>As a comic element is never absent
from the most tragic events, I may interpolate
here a little story <i>anent</i> Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Blank. That gallant officer rejoiced in a
long and scanty moustache, which up to
the moment of the Mutiny had retained
the glossy black of youth. A few days
afterwards, an officer who met me asked
me if I had observed the terrible effect
which late events had evidently wrought
on the Colonel. "Poor fellow!" said
he, "his hair has turned perfectly white!"
My irreverent laughter amazed and
shocked him. He little knew that the
blanching of the old gentleman's moustache
was due to his not having had the
time or the presence of mind to bring
with him in his hurried flight from the
mutineers his trusty bottle of hair-dye.</p>

<p>A very few nights after the Generals
and other officers had taken up their
quarters in the barrack already mentioned,
they suffered from a scare which, if
it did not whiten their hair, might easily
have proved a very serious matter to its
innocent cause. This was how it happened.
It must be premised that a
row of beds lined each wall of the long
barrack-room, each bed containing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
General, a staff, or at the least a field
officer, every one of whom reposed his
head on a pillow under which lay a
revolver, while his sword was either resting
on a chair beside him or hanging
on the wall. Outside was a guard of
British soldiers, and in the immediate
vicinity were some fifteen or sixteen
hundred more. Altogether as secure
and well-guarded a dormitory as it is
possible to conceive, and one in which
the most timid and nerve-shaken creature
might placidly entrust himself to
the arms of Morpheus. Not so, thought
one of its warrior occupants. Were
there not three Hindu punkah-coolies in
the verandah, and were not all their lives
at the mercy of these miscreants? It
behoved one at least to remain on the
alert, and, with a watchful eye on the
coolie toiling at the punkah rope at one
end of the room, to safeguard the lives
of all the careless sleepers. He should
be that one! So, ostentatiously snoring,
and pretending to be wrapped in slumber,
he devoted himself to his task. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
couple of hours passed without incident;
but at last his vigilance was justified and
rewarded. The ruffian at the rope who,
while there remained a chance that any
of his proposed victims might be still
awake, had pulled with steady cadence
the heavy punkahs, now began to simulate
slumber, and at intervals to cease
pulling. Evidently this was a deep and
artful ruse to discover if the cessation of
the fanning breeze might, peradventure,
rouse any of the sleepers; but none of
them stirred. The moment for action
had clearly arrived. So the blood-thirsty
coolie coughed a smothered cough once
or twice as a signal to his two confederates
in the verandah; but as no response
came, he prepared to go and personally
warn them. As a precautionary measure,
however, he noiselessly laid down the
rope, and, approaching the nearest sleepers,
bent over them to satisfy himself that
they were really unconscious. As he repeated
this performance over our watchful
friend, whose hair was now standing
on end with horror, he found himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
suddenly clutched in the embrace of a
pair of arms nerved with the strength of
panic fear, while loud shouts of "I've got
him! I've got him!" echoed through the
room. Breathless with excitement, the
bold captor told his thrilling tale, and demanded
that the three villains should be
led to instant execution. He laughed to
scorn the plausible story of his captive,
to the effect that he had been left at the
punkah rope longer than his rightful turn,
that he had coughed to attract the attention
of his "budlee" or relieving coolie,
that on this signal failing he had then
determined to go and fetch him; but <i>dur
ki maree</i>, "the fear of being beaten," had
induced him to make sure, before doing
so, that none of the "sahibs" was likely
to jump up, and, <i>more Anglo-Indico</i>, chastise
him. Fortunately for the wretched
coolie his explanation was accepted, not
without much laughter, and he escaped
the gallows; but nothing could ever
convince his gallant captor that he had
not by his courage and presence of mind
averted a dreadful massacre.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>It is really difficult to exaggerate the
demoralisation which at that period
seemed to overcome the nerves of certain
of the more weak-kneed among us.
Every native was to their excited imagination
a "Pandy." My own faithful
bearer, Sheodeen, owed to the natty
twist of his turban and the martial way
in which he habitually curled up his
moustaches, a very close interview with
the hangman. He was, during my absence,
arrested, and would undoubtedly
have been given a short shrift if an
officer who knew him had not sent for
me in hot haste. My earnest advice to
him after that grim experience was to
roll his "puggrie" anyhow, to take the
curl out of his moustaches, to drop his
jaunty swaggering gait, and generally
to look as mean and dirty as possible.</p>

<p>On the night of the 11th an adventure
happened to myself, which at the time
I was rather shy of mentioning, but
which I may now relate. I had taken
it on myself to do a little patrolling on
my own account; and as I was starting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
from near the main gate of the "Dumdama,"
I came across a Eurasian Trumpeter
named Murray, of my own regiment.
As he was mounted I asked him
to accompany me. This he did. We had
not gone far before we saw, indistinctly,
through the dusk, what appeared to be a
small group of the rebels, cautiously
creeping towards where a tree, growing
close to the wall, gave them a fair chance
of successfully scaling it. "Will you
stick by me, Murray, and charge them?"
I whispered. "That I will, sir," replied
he: "I will stand by you to the last drop
of my blood." So, drawing our swords,
and moving quietly forward for a few
yards, we suddenly clapped spurs to
our horses and charged&mdash;to the bewilderment
and complete demoralisation of
a speckled cow, over whose body we
narrowly escaped "coming to grief," and
who, as soon as she could recover her
senses, dashed off into the darkness.
"Never mind, Murray," said I. "It
might have been the Pandies, you know.
We'll just say nothing about this&mdash;yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a while." Poor fellow! he was killed not
many days afterwards, bravely fighting,
at the Hindun Nuddee.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 15th May the
native Sappers and Miners from Roorkee
marched into Meerut. Next afternoon
it so happened that a small party of the
faithful remnant of the 3rd Light Cavalry,
which was about to proceed under
my command to the support of the civil
authorities in a neighbouring station,
was paraded, mounted, for the General's
inspection, close to the barrack where he
had taken up his quarters, when I heard
the report of a single shot, rapidly followed
by two or three more, from the
direction of the Sapper Camp; and presently
saw that a scene of confusion and
uproar was going on there. A rumour
reached me&mdash;how I do not remember&mdash;that
the Sappers had mutinied, had killed
Alfred Light, the artillery officer who
afterwards became so distinguished, and
were about to fly into the jungle. Naturally
I lost no time in dismounting and
running in to the barrack to inform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
General Hewett, whom I found in the
dishabille of shirt and pyjamas.</p>

<p>While I was making my report to the
bewildered General, Brigadier Archdale
Wilson pushed up to us, buckling on his
sword-belt, and ordered me to mount at
once and follow the Sappers and keep
them in sight till he could come up with
some of the Carabineers and guns. By
this time the Sappers, who, I firmly believe,
had at first no intention whatever
of mutinying, but had been seized by
sudden panic through groundless fear of
an attack by the European troops, were
swarming in flight over the plain, some
in uniform, some in native clothes, but
all armed with their muskets.</p>

<p>The shot which I had heard had been
fired, as I subsequently learnt, by an
Afghan, and had killed the Commanding
Officer, Major Fraser. The action of this
one man compromised all his comrades.
However loyally disposed they might
have been, they must have felt that now
appearances were so fatally against them
that no quarter could be hoped for from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the enraged European troops who surrounded
them; and that instant flight
offered the only slender chance of escape
from destruction.</p>

<p>As my little party galloped after
them I was stopped by an artillery
officer, evidently senior in rank to myself,
who ordered me to halt and asked me
where I was going. I told him that the
Brigadier-General had ordered me to
follow the Sappers who had mutinied
and killed Alfred Light. "That is
hardly possible," he said, "seeing that
I am Alfred Light. These Sappers are
not mutinying at all, but are going with
permission to destroy a neighbouring
village of budmashes. You stop where
you are. I will take the responsibility."
Taken quite aback by all this, I was still
remonstrating with him when the Brigadier-General
rode up, furious with me
for having halted, and ordered me on
again. I was glad to leave Alfred Light
to settle the question of my delay with
him, and dashed on in pursuit. Soon
we overtook about fifty men, who took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
refuge in a grove of trees surrounded by
a wall; and there I kept guard over them
till the arrival of the Brigadier-General
with a squadron of Carabineers and some
guns. A few rounds were fired into the
grove, but without much effect, and then
dismounted Carabineers and a number
of officers skirmished into it, and pursued
the Sappers from tree to tree. The poor
fellows fought with the energy of despair.
No quarter was given, and all were destroyed,
except two who were made prisoners
by myself, and who, I believe,
were afterwards retained in the service,
and proved perfectly loyal.</p>

<p>At the close of this affair I noticed
a man who had retreated through the
grove and had taken refuge behind a low
wall on its further side, from which shelter
he betrayed himself by firing at us.</p>

<p>As I rode round the outside of the
enclosure on its left and got in line with
him, a Trooper of the Carabineers appeared
at the opposite end of the wall,
and we both came down on him at full
gallop. The Sapper jumped to his feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
and fixed his bayonet. We reached him
almost at the same moment. As the
Trooper lifted his sword to deliver a
swinging cut the Sapper charged him
with his bayonet and transfixed him
through the breast, with a sickening ripping
sound which still haunts my ears,
while my straining sword arm failed by
an inch to reach and lift the bayonet.
Before he could withdraw the bayonet I
had run him through the body. The
uplifted arm of the Carabineer dropped,
the sword slipped from his grasp, he
reeled for a moment on his saddle, and
then fell to the ground dead.</p>

<p>A correspondent wrote to the <i>Pioneer</i>:&mdash;"The
Carabineer who was killed just
outside Meerut in the Sapper Affair was
a Trooper, named Frederick Kingsford,
who rode an untrained horse, which became
unsteady at the time of charging
the rebel. He was the first man killed
in action in the Mutiny, although many
Europeans had fallen before that day."</p>

<p>It was late in the evening when we
returned to cantonments. The destination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of my small party, which was to
have started next morning into the district,
was unexpectedly changed.</p>

<p>A message had been received by
General Hewett from a party of fugitives
from Delhi, who were wandering about in
the jungles near that place, and who implored
that help should be sent to them.
When I heard of this I felt that women
and children could not possibly be left
to their fate among the rebels without
at least an effort being made to save them;
so I went to General Hewett and offered
to attempt the rescue with twenty-five men
of the remnant of my regiment. He
asked if I was in earnest, and told me
that the fugitives had not got far from
Delhi, and that he had considered it
hopeless to send a succouring party.
The letter, which was written in the
French language, had been thrown under
a table, whence I saw it picked up. The
General then gave me permission, and
on the forenoon of the 17th my party
started. On our way out of Meerut we
met Lieutenant Hugh Gough of our regiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
(now Sir H. Gough, <i>V.C.</i>, <i>K.C.B.</i>,
commanding the Lahore Division). He
told me that he had just heard of my
having volunteered for this duty, and
that he could not let me go alone. So
he galloped back to get his arms, and
thus, in this most gallant and self-sacrificing
manner, came with me on an errand
which both of us felt pretty sure was to
be our last. We rode all day, expecting
every moment our men to turn on us and
bolt to Delhi. The temptation must have
been very sore to them; for they had
witnessed the extreme demoralisation
which the Mutiny had caused in Meerut;
but providentially they remained staunch.
Only once did we meet with a show of
opposition at a large village, but most
fortunately we thought it probable that
the inhabitants were alarmed at our
French-grey uniforms, and took us for a
party of mutineers on the prowl. So
Gough and I halted the men and rode
on alone. The sight of our white faces
re-assured the villagers, and our explanations
calmed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the evening we arrived at the
village of Hirchinpore, where we had ascertained
from people in the fields that
the fugitives were to be found. Again
our light-grey uniforms caused alarm
and confusion. The gate of a walled
enclosure was shut in our faces, and it
was with great difficulty that we got
those inside to believe that we were
friends. At last, on our promising to
leave the men outside, Gough and I were
admitted; and we rode in, not without
suspicion that we might ourselves have
fallen into a trap. We found a very dark
old gentleman called Cohen, the zemindar
of the village, an Orientalised Jew I
think, seated in the doorway with a
gun in his hand, evidently determined in
case of treachery to sell his life dearly.
The fugitives of whom we were in search
had in despair stowed themselves away
in various hiding places, and when they
appeared presented a pitiable spectacle
from the effects of the hardships they
had undergone. All that night we had
to remain there while Cohen's people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
collected carts to convey the women and
children. If one of our men or one of
the villagers had bolted and carried to
Delhi the news of what a haul could be
made at Hirchinpore, two or three hours
would have sealed our fate. But again
Providence befriended us, and early next
morning our little caravan started for
Meerut, where we safely arrived that
night, and I had the joy of once more
seeing my Sister, of whom I could not
bear to take leave when I started, and
who had been in ignorance of my having
gone till I was miles on my way. The
following are the names of the ladies and
gentlemen who composed the party of
fugitives:&mdash;</p>

<p>Very glad was I to turn in that might
with the prospect of a good rest, but I
had not been asleep very long before the
late Major Sanford, then a Lieutenant
in my old regiment, and one of the most
gallant gentlemen that ever buckled on
a sword-belt, came and woke me up and
told me that he had volunteered to carry
despatches from General Hewett to the
Commander-in-Chief at Umballa <i>viâ</i>
Kurnal, and that he wanted me to escort
him with my little faithful party. Of
course I agreed, and went off to our
lines, where the already tired men
willingly consented to undertake the
fresh and still more fatiguing and possibly
more dangerous journey. Their
horses were, however, quite knocked up,
so I asked and obtained permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to select for them twenty-five of the
partially-broken remounts of the Carabineers.</p>

<p>Early in the morning we paraded in
the lightest of light marching order, the
young horses vigorously resenting being
so unceremoniously pressed into the
ranks before passing through Riding
School. For the first few miles there
was not much order in our little column.
The half-broken troopers rearing, buck-jumping
and plunging about, had it
pretty much their own way; but before
night they were quiet enough. All day
we marched, and all night, and all next
day, halting for an hour or so at a time,
when a wayside well enabled us to water
the horses. We requisitioned feeds of
grain for them and of chuppatis for ourselves
as we went along, duly giving
receipts for them. <i>En route</i> we made a
long detour off the road to a district
where we had been ordered to go in
search of baggage-camels, which we were
to have seized if we had found them; but
they had departed. On the second day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
we met the late gallant Major (then
Lieutenant) Hodson who, escorted by a
party of the Jhind Horse, had started on
his ride to Meerut with despatches from
General Anson to General Hewett, and
who was to return with despatches from
the latter to Army Head-Quarters. So
unexpected was this meeting that at first
each party took the other for "moofsids,"
as we used in those days to designate
the rebels; but we soon discovered our
mistake. Hodson was naturally much
relieved to find that the road in front of
him was open, though doubtless disappointed
that his errand was forestalled.
The reader, who has read of Hodson's
famous ride to Meerut, and who has not
to this moment ever heard that it was
anticipated by others, will probably be
surprised by this narration, but nevertheless
it is simply true. The credit of
carrying the first despatches from Meerut
to Umballa is due to the late Major Sanford,
who, to me and to all who knew
him, was a type of all that is most noble
and brave and modest; but alas! his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
memory is buried in our hearts. The
world has heard little of him.</p>

<p>In the evening we arrived at Kurnal,
having traversed in less than thirty-six
hours more than ninety miles: for the
straight road between Meerut and Kurnal
is seventy-six, and our fruitless detour
after the camels took us many more
miles. Sanford at once went on by dâk
to Umballa and delivered his despatches
to General Anson. He eventually got
command of the cavalry of the guide
corps before Delhi, and retained it till
the close of the siege.</p>

<p>My small party was not then sent back
to Meerut, but moved down towards
Delhi with the advanced body of troops,
making itself useful in collecting supplies
and scouting. On the road we
succeeded in capturing several miscreants
who had committed murderous outrages
on our unfortunate countrymen
and women while trying to effect their
escape from Delhi. They were given
the benefit of a fair trial; and those who
were found guilty were duly hanged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
One of these wretches who had been
tried and sentenced one afternoon was
subsequently confined till sunset&mdash;the
usual hour for executions&mdash;in the guard
tent of the 1st Bengal Fusiliers, which
happened on that occasion to contain
another tenant, an Irish soldier who had
been drinking, "not wisely but too well."
When the Provost Marshal's party came
in the evening for the condemned criminal
they found him in a sorry plight.
The half-sober Irishman begged that
they would not take him away. "Bedad,"
said he, "he has been the most
divarting companion I iver had." The
"divarsion" had been perhaps a little
one-sided.</p>

<p>One evening, shortly before the force
reached Alipore, I was suddenly ordered
to take my party back to Meerut <i>viâ</i>
Bagput, for the General expected an
engagement, and evidently felt uncertain
as to whether my men were to be trusted
under such trying circumstances as an
actual fight against their old comrades.
Previously to this poor General Anson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
had died, worn out by anxiety and fatigue,
and General Barnard was in command.
Accompanied by the Adjutant-General,
Colonel Chester, and by his
Interpreter, Captain Howell, he inspected
my little party on parade, and after
praising its conduct in the highest terms,
informed us that he would give each
native member of it a step of substantive
rank for each of the two expeditions
in which they had shared. He then told
them that in a short time he expected to
engage the rebels, and that, though he
had no doubt of their loyalty, he was
unwilling to take them into action
against men who so lately had been
their comrades, of their own race and
religions, and that therefore he had decided
to send them back to Meerut. The
whole of them implored to be allowed to
remain and to prove their loyalty in the
field; but the General was not to be turned
from his decision. He was evidently
much moved, and for a moment I hoped
that he was wavering; but presently he
turned away; and with deep disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
I felt that there was nothing for it
but to turn our horses' heads to the east
and make for the ferry at Bagput. Before
General Barnard could carry out his
promise he fell a victim to cholera.
Colonel Chester was killed in action, and
Captain Howell also died&mdash;I think from
that scourge of the camp&mdash;cholera. Thus
was left on my shoulders the whole <i>onus</i>
of securing to my men the fulfilment of
the General's promise&mdash;a task in which,
after much trouble and delay, I was happily
eventually successful.</p>

<p>To march off the ground and out of
camp no preparations were needed, for
we were without camp equipage of any
kind whatever. It must be remembered
that all this took place in the middle of
the hot weather, before the rains; so that
it was no hardship to sleep in the open
air on the ground beside our horses, who
also required no blankets. Except our
horses, their saddles and bridles and
our arms, and the clothes on our backs,
we possessed literally nothing in the
world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not long, therefore, before we
had put a good distance between ourselves
and our late comrades. When
dawn broke we found ourselves debouching
from a grove of trees on to a plain,
at the further side of which was the river
and the bridge-of-boats with the village
of Bagput on the opposite bank; but to
our horror the bridge was occupied by a
strong body of apparently rebel troops,
whom our appearance threw into sudden
commotion. We could see infantry
rapidly falling in, troopers mounting in
hot haste, and camels and elephants
rushing to the bridge, flying from our
expected onslaught. Scant time was
there to decide on a course of action.
With our tired horses escape from so
strong a body of cavalry was hopeless.
Nothing was left but to charge the bridge
and trust to luck and the rapidity of our
attack to disconcert the enemy, and
enable some at least of us to get through
with whole skins. These were the days
of drilling by "threes;" but as I judged
that there would be room for four men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
abreast on the bridge, I formed my party
as quickly as possible into what would
now be called a column of sections of
fours, and moved down the slope on to
the plain at a gallop, increasing our pace
as we approached the bridge. To my
delight and surprise the enemy seemed
quite demoralised and in confusion,
and I was beginning to feel sure of
a successful rush through them, when I
was startled by the apparition of a white
face peering at me from behind a mass
of stones, and the shout of an English
voice yelling at me to halt. Never was
man more relieved and pleased to be out
of a frightful scrape. In another second
I had halted my party and had ridden
across the bridge and was talking to &mdash;&mdash;,
an officer who informed me that he had
been sent with a strong body of the Raja
of Jhind's troops to occupy the bridge
and hold it till further orders; but he
said that he was not going to stay any
longer. The place was a great deal too
near Delhi and too liable to sudden
attack to please him, and the fright he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
had got from the sudden appearance of
my small party had put the finishing
touch to his resolution. He said that
our French-grey uniforms and the swiftness
of our attack had convinced him
that we were the advanced party of a
large body of the enemy, and he had
given himself up for lost. At any
rate he had had enough of Bagput and
meant to be off at once. In vain I implored
him to defer his departure till the
evening, pointing out that my horses
were quite done up, and that we would
be obliged to stop there for some hours to
rest and feed. Nothing would move him,
and there and then he marched off, bag
and baggage, and left us to our own devices.
We could plainly hear the guns
of a fight, which must have been that at
the Hindun Nuddee; and, tired as we
were, rest was impossible. In the afternoon
we moved on, and next morning
marched into Meerut without further
misadventure.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>III.<br />
BEFORE DELHI.</h2>


<p>For the next few weeks time passed
quietly enough with me. The greater
portion of the garrison of Meerut had
gone to strengthen the besieging force
at Delhi; and had, under Brigadier-General
Archdale Wilson, at the hard
fought battles at the Hindun Nuddee,
gloriously wiped away the reproach of
the supine inaction which had been imposed
on it by General Hewett on the
10th of May. We, who were left to kick
our heels in idleness at Meerut, spent
most of our time in moving Heaven and
Earth to get transferred to the army at
Delhi. At last the red-letter-day came
for me. My friend and comrade, Captain
Sanford, had been appointed to
officiate in the command of the Cavalry
of the Guides Corps, and he lost no time
in writing to me and promising that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
I could get over to Delhi, he would manage
to have me attached to the regiment.
At that moment I was laid up
with a touch of fever, due probably to
previous exposure; but I was not long
in presenting myself to the Staff Officer
of the garrison and shewing him Sanford's
letter, taking very good care not
to remind him that I was on the sick
list&mdash;a circumstance which he fortunately
overlooked. That afternoon I joyfully
took French leave of the Doctor, and
started in company with some half-dozen
other officers, who were also bound
for the Delhi force, back again along
the well-remembered track to Bagput.
We marched at night, thinking that we
were then, more likely than in the day
time, to escape encounter with any prowling
bands of rebels or Goojars. The
district between Meerut and Bagput
was infested by the latter, a tribe of
hereditary criminals whose chief amusement
during peaceful times seems to
consist in effecting breaches of the Penal
Code, while they invariably take advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of periods of disturbance to indulge
to the utmost their ingrained predatory
propensities. Small as our party was,
we were therefore careful to adopt all
practical precautions. As I knew the
road I was sent in advance as a scout,
while on each flank rode another officer,
the main body of three or four men
detaching one more to the rear. In this
order we rode all night, fortunately
without adventure; and in the gray
dawn we reached Bagput.</p>

<p>The bridge-of-boats had been removed,
and we crossed the river in a large flat-bottomed
ferry boat. Here we had the
misfortune to lose one of our horses, belonging
to Captain Craigie of my regiment.
His owner had neglected to unfasten
the rather tight standing-martingale
which he always used; and this
hampered the animal when it tried to
jump into the boat, and caused it to
fall into the deep water between it and
the bank. Even now all would have
been well but for that unlucky standing-martingale
which entirely prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the struggling horse from swimming,
and held its nose hopelessly underwater
till it was drowned, without any possibility
of help being given it. In a few
moments the poor horse sank, carrying
with it Craigie's saddle and bridle and a
revolver which was in one of the holsters.
The efforts which some native
divers made to recover the saddle, &amp;c.,
were fruitless; and we had to abandon
the endeavour, borrow a "country" nag
for Craigie, and cross the river. When
we reached the opposite bank we heard
shouts from the Bagput side, and saw
men holding up the saddle and revolver
which they had succeeded in fishing up.
That was, however, the last that Craigie
saw of his property. As we crossed the
stretch of sand on the further bank we
narrowly escaped another casualty; for
one of our party got into a quicksand,
and for some moments horse and man
were in serious danger of being swallowed
up. At last, however, we all got
safely under way and continued the
second half of our journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Never shall I forget the moment when,
from a rising ground, the frowning walls
of Delhi and the white tents of the besieging
force burst into view.</p>

<p>So vast an extent of ground was
covered by the huge city&mdash;so puny
and diminutive in comparison was the
encampment which nestled under the
famous "Ridge!" Truly a sight to fill
the heart with exulting pride; for we
knew that the men in these tent were
sure, some day before many weeks were
over, to storm the formidable walls of
the great fortress, and to carry the British
flag in triumph into its innermost
citadel. No shadow of doubt of the
ultimate success of our arms ever troubled
any of our minds in those days.
The insolent belief in the irresistibility
of the <i>furor Britannicus</i> had not then
met any of the rude shocks which in latter
days have somewhat shaken it, in spite
of an army composed of short-service
soldiers and of leaders trained to a pitch
of theoretical perfection by the Professors
of the Staff College.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Directly we arrived in camp I reported
myself to Sir Henry Norman, then Assistant
Adjutant-General of the Force,
and, I think, in rank a captain. In a
few hours I was put in orders as attached
to the Cavalry of the Guides. The
famous forced march of that splendid
corps under Daly from Hoti Murdan to
Delhi is matter of history, and can never
be forgotten. The honourable roll of its
losses in officers and men during the
siege is recorded on a tablet on the wall
of the memorial tower on the Ridge.</p>

<p>I do not propose to inflict on the reader's
patience the often-told story of the
siege. That task has been performed
by far abler pens than mine. It will be
sufficient for me to endeavour to sketch
two or three of the minor episodes at
which I was present, and which seemed
to me to be picturesque or interesting.</p>

<p>As may be easily understood, much
of our time in the Cavalry branch was
occupied on picquet or outpost duty. One
of these outposts, at a place called, I
think, Azadpore, far away on the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
right rear of our position, was
peculiarly liable to attack, as it was
pretty well "in the air," and offered a
tempting object for a sudden swoop by a
large body of the enemy. One afternoon
when my commanding officer, Captain
Sanford, and myself, being off duty,
were mounting to enjoy a quiet ride,
we became aware of a great commotion
in the Azadpore direction. Clouds of
dust rapidly whirling in the air! Camels
and grass-cutters' ponies flying wildly
to the camp! Evidently something
wrong! "Gallop to the lines. Sound
the Boot-and-Saddle and the Mount"
was the order Captain Sanford gave me,
while he tore off into the clouds of dust
to reconnoitre. Instantly was the quiet
of our camp changed into a scene of the
liveliest bustle. Horses being saddled&mdash;men
tumbling out of their tents&mdash;buckling
on their belts&mdash;jumping on their
horses, and "falling in"&mdash;all this in
frantic haste&mdash;when Sanford returned
and shouted to me "Bring along as
many men as have mounted. Never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
mind telling off. The Azadpore picquet
is being driven in." By this time not
more than 20 or 25 men were in their
saddles, and away we went after Sanford
as hard as we could tear, leaving
the rest of the regiment to follow as
soon as it could be got together. Through
the flying animals and camp followers,
many of them wounded, we galloped
along, straining our eyes into the distance;
and presently we saw the picquet,
surrounded by clouds of the rebel
horse, being driven slowly back, stubbornly
fighting and disputing every inch
of ground. As we hove into sight the
enemy more or less disengaged itself
from the picquet, and attempted to throw
itself into formation to meet our attack.
There must have been several hundred
of them. The whole ground in front
seemed thick with them; and I must
confess my heart sank within me when
the gallant Sanford, instead of waiting
for the reinforcements which must have
been close behind us, simply increased
the pace, and evidently meant to hurl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
our small party straight into the overwhelming
mass before us. "It is all
up with you this time" was my ejaculation
to myself, but "needs must" when&mdash;one's
commanding officer leads! So
I set my teeth and determined to make
the best of a bad job. Could I believe
my eyes? The dense body that had
begun to advance against us slowed
down to a walk&mdash;halted&mdash;wavered&mdash;and
finally scattered! With a roar we
charged into them. Our pace was so
great that it was impossible for them to
put on the steam in time to escape our
onslaught. The picquet joined in&mdash;our
own reinforcements caught us up&mdash;and
then was seen on that plain as pretty
a bout of sword play as ever rejoiced the
heart of a horseman. No attempt at
keeping order was possible. As the
"Pandies" scattered, so did we, each
man singling out his victim. The
slaughter of the enemy was considerable,
the losses on our side extremely
trifling. As the fierce pursuit rolled on
we became aware that the masses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the flying mutineers were thickening in
our front, and were gradually concentrating
towards one point. Evidently some
obstruction prevented their escape to
the flanks. At last a huge living wedge
of frantic, struggling, panic-stricken men
and horses was crowded together, hemmed
in between a deep canal and a
masonry aqueduct which crossed it at
right angles. Into this solid mass it
was impossible to penetrate, but the
outer fringe of it was mowed down by
the <i>tulwars</i> of our men. No quarter
was ever given or taken before Delhi.
If the mutineers had been cruel as the
most savage of wild beasts, fearful was
the revenge which many and many a
time was wreaked on them by our maddened
troops.</p>

<p>Where the aqueduct crossed the canal
it had been partially destroyed, and on
the masses of fallen masonry it was just
possible for one horseman at a time to
pick his way across; but where one
escaped many were overthrown and
trampled on by the struggling mob.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
It had been comparatively easy for the
enemy, intent on the surprise of the Azadpore
picquet, to steal across in single
file; but it was quite a different thing
for a confused and terrified crowd to force
its way across. At this point great
slaughter took place, and many, in
despair, turned round and charged
their pursuers, only to meet a certain
and speedy death. One poor wretch,
extricating himself from the crowd,
jumped his horse on to a detached
fragment of the broken aqueduct
on the plain before it joined the canal,
and there he stood, as on a pedestal
six or eight feet high, in vain
seeking a short respite from his inevitable
fate. Almost simultaneously one
of our men sprung his horse alongside
of him, and on that precarious platform,
with barely footing for their horses, these
two engaged in a savage fight for life.
Like lightning their swords flashed as
they cut at each other without any attempt
at parrying. In a second or two
our man received a frightful slash on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
his arm, and it would have gone hard
with him if at that moment one of his
comrades who was armed with a long
spear had not charged straight at the
group, and, as he pulled his horse up
on its haunches at the base of the masonry,
transfixed the Pandy through the
body. At the same instant our man,
maddened with pain and excitement,
drove his horse against his antagonist
and thrust him clean off the block of
masonry, horses and men all rolling together
on the ground below.</p>

<p>The survivors of the adventurous spirits
who had attacked the outpost rode back
into Delhi that night considerably crestfallen.</p>

<p>The picquet had been furnished by
one of the Punjab cavalry regiments,
and was commanded by a gentleman
of a rather taciturn habit who is still
well remembered under his nickname of
"Fowls." Never shall I forget the quaint
but gallant spectacle which he presented,
as with his faithful quizzing glass firmly
glued on to one eye he faced his enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and laid about him with his sword,
grimly silent, while being slowly driven
back by the <i>force majeure</i> of overwhelming
numbers. The story goes that he
earned his <i>petit nom</i> as follows:&mdash;On
some occasion, on the line of march, he
had, for days and weeks, ridden solemnly
and silently among his comrades.
Not a word had ever escaped his lips
till, on one memorable morning, as his
detachment entered a village, our friend,
who must have been gloomily pondering
on the scantiness of the supplies in the
camp larder of the mess, espied a family
of <i>moorgis</i> busily scratching up the dust
on the road before him. The welcome
sight was too much for him. Then and
there he lifted up his voice and cried
"Fowls!" and straightway relapsed into
pristine dumbness. Seldom if ever has
so short a speech been greeted with such
loud applause. His delighted comrades,
now that the spell was broken, naturally
hoped that the sudden ejaculation was
but a preliminary to a permanent loosening
of the hitherto tied tongue; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
were doomed to disappointment. From
that time forth not a word escaped those
lips. Neither fowls nor ducks nor geese
nor turkeys, nor even sheep availed any
more to draw forth the slightest oral token
of appreciation&mdash;merely would the half
sleepy eyes glisten into life at the sight
of the welcome "find," and possibly a
nod of the head would direct attention
to it. Thus came it about that the soubriquet
of "Fowls" was by unanimous
vote conferred on its possessor.</p>

<p>That evening when we were all assembled
at dinner in the mess tent, an
unfortunate "Pandy" who had been
found skulking under a bush by some
of our men was brought before the commanding
officer. There was no mistaking
him for anything but a sepoy;
and there could be no doubt about his
fate. Still I could not help thinking his
luck was very hard; and doubtless my
face betrayed my feelings; for the unfortunate
man, with an appealing look
at me, declared he was no sepoy, but had
been my domestic servant; and he implored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
me to bear witness to his truth
and save his life. What could I do! It
was impossible to swear to a falsehood;
but I pleaded hard, though, I fear, unsuccessfully,
that he might be allowed
to escape.</p>

<p>During one of the numerous encounters
with the enemy which kept the camp
before Delhi lively, an officer serving
with the infantry of the Guides Corps
was wounded in a manner sufficiently
curious to deserve record. During a
pause in the operations he was standing
with his back to a tree when a bullet
struck the ground close to him, and
caused a fragment of stone to fly up
against his forehead, on which it inflicted
a slight flesh wound. As he threw his
head back at the sudden shock, it came
in contact with a sharp splinter of a broken
branch sticking out from the tree.
Instinctively he put his right hand up to
his forehead. It was covered with blood.
Then he felt the back of his head with
his left hand. That also was all bloody.
"My God!" He exclaimed, "I'm a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
dead man! Shot right through the
head!" and he sought a soft place to lie
down on and die, an event which he expected
to take place in a second or two.
To his surprise, after fully a minute, he
was as alive as ever. So, again, he felt
the two wounds. There was no mistake
about it. They were both bleeding
freely. Once more he curled himself
up; but as death did not come, he presently
began to think that there must be
something strange and abnormal about
the hole right through his head, and his
relief may be imagined, when a brother
officer, after a hurried examination of it,
explained matters to him. I am afraid
he was flippant enough, as he jumped to
his feet, to join in the laugh against
himself. Wonderful recoveries from
apparently mortal wounds were by no
means uncommon. I have myself seen
an officer hit full in the chest by a bullet
which came out at his back. I jumped
off my horse and wrung his hand for the
last farewell, and rode on (for this occurred
during a pursuit), leaving him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
the care of the surgeon who at that moment
came up. What was my surprise
to find, many hours afterwards when we
returned to camp, that the wounded
officer was not only not dead, but not
likely to die. The bullet had glanced
off a rib and gone round his chest under
the skin, and so out of his back. Another
officer had his jaw smashed by a
bullet which did not apparently make
its exit anywhere. The simple fact was
that he swallowed it, along with some
of his teeth.</p>

<p>On the Ridge stood a lofty building,
the Observatory Tower, from the summit
of which, during the early part of
the siege, a look-out used to be kept on
the operations of the enemy.</p>

<p>This fact becoming known, drew on
the tower an altogether undesirable
share of attention from the guns on the
walls of Delhi; and the upper parts of
it soon got considerably knocked about
by shot and shell. Long after this look-out
post had been withdrawn occasional
shells used still to be "loosed off" at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the tower, making things rather hot for
the small knot of officers off duty which
used generally to be found up there
enjoying the view when anything more
interesting than usual was going on in
front. On one occasion two or three
other men and myself had found our way
to the top of it, when we were joined by
a gentleman connected with a mercantile
firm, to whose enterprise the camp
was indebted for its supplies of "tar
bund" beer (a luxury for which we were
glad to pay sixteen rupees a dozen),
Exshaw's brandy and Harvey's sauce,
and many varieties of tinned provisions,
besides Holloway's pills and ointment,
and such like patent nostrums. While
we were all looking at the walls of the
city, a puff of white smoke was seen to
issue from a point known to us as "the
hole in the wall" where dwelt a mortar
of large calibre. In a few seconds the
big shell vomited out from it burst high
in the air, fully a quarter of a mile away
from us, but in a very accurate alignment
for our position. "Down," shouted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
one of our number, and we all, with the
exception of our civilian friend, crouched
behind a heavy mass of solid masonry.
He, however, stood his ground, folded
his arms across his chest, and for a
moment surveyed us with a look of half
contemptuous surprise. "Why have
these stupid fellows sought shelter?"
thought he. "The shell has burst ever
so far away. The danger is all over
now. The pieces must be falling to the
ground." Very speedily was he undeceived.
Hurtling and hissing, the broken
fragments of the shell came rushing
onwards and crashed against the tower,
fortunately without hitting him. As we
stood up he threw himself down. He
then learned a lesson, which I dare say
he did not soon forget, concerning the
momentum of projectiles, and the general
advisability of taking a hint from persons
presumably likely to know what
they were about.</p>

<p>All this time the siege, if so it could
be described, "dragged its slow length
along;" but in reality, neither was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
City invested by us, nor was our force
besieged, as has been so often asserted,
by the rebel troops. Both forces lay
facing each other. Both were in contact
along a comparatively short front.
Both were entirely open to their respective
rear, with practically unmenaced
communications in those directions. Neither
could prevent reinforcements or
supplies reaching the other. We on our
part could not even attempt to intercept
the various contingents of mutineers
which, during the early part of the siege,
poured into Delhi from the south; and
were hurled, in almost monotonous succession,
against our position, while still
fresh and undemoralised by defeat, only
to be driven back, time after time, with
immense slaughter, by the invincible
little phalanx of Britons, Sikhs and
Gurkhas, which sturdily clung, bull-dog
fashion, to the ground it had taken up.
For a time the numbers of the enemy
continued to increase, as almost daily
fresh bodies by regiments and brigades
marched into the already crowded city,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
their arrival noisily saluted by heavy artillery.
Our muster roll, on the other
hand, far from augmenting, actually
dwindled away; for incessant losses from
casualties in action were heavily supplemented
by deaths from fever and cholera;
and our much-needed reinforcements
were long in coming. But we
rested secure in the firm assurance that
sooner or later they would certainly come.
We all knew that John Lawrence and his
lieutenants were straining every nerve
to secure the safety of the Punjab in our
rear, by disarming the disaffected Hindustani
regiments in that province, and
by raising fresh ones, both of cavalry
and infantry, from the staunch fighting
men of the Khalsa. We knew that as
swiftly as could possibly be compassed
by human forethought and human energy,
these trustworthy and brave levies,
and every British regiment that could
be spared, and every heavy gun and
mortar in the Ferozepore Arsenal, and,
almost better than all, the heroic Nicholson
would come to our aid; and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
then the real siege would begin in
earnest, and the fate of Delhi would be
sealed.</p>

<p>Early in August took place the
only serious effort on the part of the
enemy to cut off our communications. To
quote from a letter written by General
Wilson to Nicholson and received by the
latter on the 3rd of August<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>:&mdash;"The
enemy have re-established the bridge
over the Najufgurh Canal (which we had
destroyed) and have established themselves
in force there, with the intention
of moving on Alipore and our communications
with the rear. I therefore earnestly
beg you to push forward with the
utmost expedition in your power, both
to drive these fellows from my rear, and
to aid me in holding my position."
How promptly and effectually Nicholson
carried out these instructions is graphically
described in the pages of Sir John
Kaye's work. On the 14th of August
he led into the Delhi Camp the moveable
column which had already done yeoman's
service by disarming the mutinous regiments
at Phillour and Umritsar, and
destroying the Sealkote Brigade of rebels
at Trimmoo Ghât. On the 25th
of August he marched out again at the
head of a small force of all arms; and
before nightfall he had swept from Najufgurh
the "Neemuch Brigade" which
was lying in wait to intercept the siege
train on its slow approach from Ferozepore
Arsenal.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>
<p>There are some men whose personal
appearance harmonises so perfectly with
their intellectual and moral characteristics
that any one on seeing them for the
first time would be almost certain intuitively
to guess their identity. Nicholson
was one of these. Tall, dark, and stern,
he looked every inch what he was, a
fearless, self-reliant, fierce and masterful
man, born for stormy times and stirring
events. It was impossible to associate
him with anything commonplace, or
otherwise than heroic or great. On me,
as on every one else, he produced a vivid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
impression, which can never become dim.
When I first saw him it was only for a
moment. He said something in low
tones to an acquaintance, and passed on;
but instinctively I felt that I had come
into contact with one who stood apart
from and overtopped other men. "That
is Nicholson," I said, knowing that it
could be no one else.</p>

<p>On the 4th of September the huge
guns and mortars of the siege train, fitly
drawn by still more colossal elephants,
slowly and solemnly rolled through the
camp on to the Ridge. On the 6th the
very last batch of reinforcements, a detachment
of the 60th Rifles from Meerut,
arrived, marching "in their usual jaunty
way" as described by Hervey Greathead
in a letter to his wife written on that
day. The Royal Engineers had already
filled a vast "Engineers' park" with fascines,
gabions, sand bags, and every conceivable
appliance for the bombardment
and storm. Nothing had been overlooked.
Nothing remained but to begin the real
and final siege and deliver the assault.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>That no time was lost is evidenced by
the fact that one breaching battery of
six heavy guns, within seven hundred
yards of the Moree Bastion, was finished
and armed on the evening of the 6th, and
began its work of destruction on the 7th.</p>

<h2>IV.<br />
STORMING THE CITY.</h2>


<p>From that time till the morning of the
11th, when the last of the four batteries
was completed, our gallant Engineers
and working parties and Gunners worked
as men have never worked before or since.
All night long picks and spades and
shovels were busily plied, under a heavy
fire, in constructing the batteries; on
which, so soon as finished, the heavy
guns and mortars were mounted; and as
successively they were placed in position
they joined in swelling the furious
storm of shot and shell which never ceased
tearing down the masonry of the city
defences till the moment of the assault
in the grey dawn of the 14th. The last
battery was built under the shelter of the
ruined walls of the Custom-house, at a
distance of 180 yards from the water
bastion, under a terrific and incessant fire
from the Kashmir and Water bastions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and the curtain between them, Let the
reader try to realise this; and he will
admit that no more desperate or daring
enterprise was ever achieved in front of
a besieged fortress.</p>

<p>On the 13th it was my hard fate to be
on outpost duty at Azadpore, where rumours
reached me that the assault was
likely to be delivered before dawn on the
14th. My picquet should in ordinary
course have been relieved that morning,
but no relief came; and as the day wore
on, it seemed that I was destined to be
left out there kicking my heels, forlorn
and forgotten, till all should be over.
This was more than could be borne; so
I despatched messenger after messenger
into camp with imploring letters, begging
for the recall of my picquet. My entreaties
were successful, and I had the intense,
if selfish, gratification of at length seeing
in the distance the small column of dust
which heralded the approach of the party
that had been sent to take my place.
Very grumpy and sulky was the officer
in command; but, after all, it was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
turn for the duty. Every one must take
his luck as it comes. Consoling him
with this crusted old apothegm, I lost
no time in clearing out of the post and
taking my detachment back to camp;
but even then I was destined to grievous
disappointment. The troops intended
to form the Cavalry Brigade under Sir
Hope Grant had been told off, and my
party had to content itself with forming
part of the reserve which remained in
camp. So I lost the chance of being one
of the glorious six hundred, whose heroic
endurance that day under a fierce hurricane
of grape and musketry "prevented
the enemy, who had driven back the
4th Column, from advancing along the
open ground between the Ridge and the
City, and taking the whole of our left
attack in flank."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When the attempt of
the column under the gallant Colonel
Reid to force an entrance into the City
by the Lahore Gate failed, partly owing
to the want of artillery, and partly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the defeat of the auxiliary Kashmir contingent,
the whole brunt of keeping the
victorious rebels, many thousands in
numbers, from pouring out of Kissengunge
and pursuing our retreating infantry,
fell on the Cavalry Brigade. Before,
however, the enemy could dare to
trust themselves on the plain beyond the
shelter of their walls, it was necessary to
drive the horsemen from it; and fierce
was the effort to do so. From the walls
of the City, from the suburbs of Kissengunge,
a fiery hail of lead unceasingly
swept. Saddle after saddle was emptied;
horse after horse fell, but not for a moment
was there the slightest wavering
or unsteadiness. Quietly and without
confusion the ranks continued to close
together and fill ever-recurring gaps,
grimly determined to hold their ground
to the last man. Utterly unable to return
the fire, or to do anything but
remain immoveable as passive living
targets, they seemed doomed to eventual
annihilation&mdash;when Tomb's famous
troop of horse artillery galloped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
rescue. Taking up a position at the
closest of close quarters, not more than
two hundred yards from the enemy, it was
not long after our guns came into action
that they drove the hitherto triumphant
rebels back from the external walls into
the labyrinth of houses in their rear, and
materially reduced their fire. But from
the Lahore Gate an unsilenced 24-pounder
still continued to pour grape into the
ranks, and to tear many a ghastly gap
in them. Not till the rebel fire, drawn
off by the success of our attack on the
Kashmiri Gate, had dwindled away to
harmlessness, and all danger of a sortie
was effectually extinguished, was the
sorely crippled Cavalry Brigade withdrawn
from its post of honour.</p>

<p>Though this deed of the six hundred before
the walls of Delhi has not been sung
by the Poet Laureate, and is not so world-famous
as that of the other six hundred at
Balaclava, it fully deserves to be bracketed
with it as an example of heroism and
self-sacrificing devotion. Each is a brilliant
instance of the perfect union of discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and courage. If the charge of
the Light Brigade was a blunder, so
much the greater is the glory of the
brave men who rode to death without
questioning their orders.</p>

<div class="poem">
Theirs not to reason why,<br />
Theirs but to do and die.<br />
</div>

<p>There was no blunder in the order
which devoted the six hundred of the
Delhi Cavalry to face a <i>feu d'enfer</i> for the
salvation of their Infantry comrades.
Every soldier who knows what it is to
"sit still to be shot at" will appreciate
with pride the feat of arms performed on
that morning of the 14th September 1857
by the British and Native Cavalry Brigade
under the command of the fearless
and gentle Sir Hope Grant.</p>

<p>So vivid is the description of this episode
in the glowing pages of Sir John
Kaye that I find it difficult to resist the
temptation of transcribing it; but most
of my military readers are doubtless
familiar with it; and if any have not yet
read his <i>History of the Sepoy War in
India</i>, I would recommend them to lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
no time in studying that deeply interesting
work. It is an imperishable tribute
to the glory of our arms, and no one who
reads its narrative of the brave deeds
done by Englishmen, civilians as well as
soldiers, aided by Sikhs and Gurkhas
and the few other loyal races of India
during that time of supreme stress and
trial, can help feeling his heart fill with
honest and patriotic pride, and with confident
hope that if ever again so fierce a
struggle should be forced on ourselves
or our descendants, the old spirit of the
Anglo-Saxon race will prove true to
itself.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to describe the
various fortunes of the four columns of
assault. That story has been told once
for all by Sir John Kaye; and it is not
likely that any more full or clear or correct
narrative will ever be written.</p>

<p>Full of triumph as we who remained
outside were at the knowledge that the
Kashmiri Gate and curtain had been
successfully stormed, and that our flag
was flying on the ramparts which had so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
long defied us, it was yet inexpressibly
mournful to witness the long procession
of "doolies" bearing the dead and
wounded which streamed slowly back
into camp. Many a gallant soldier that
day gave his life for the honour of his
Queen and country; but the loss that
overshadowed all others was that of the
valiant Nicholson, struck down with a
mortal wound in the hour of victory while
nobly exposing himself to almost certain
death in the act of cheering forward his
men, who were for a moment checked
by a torrent of lead that swept the narrow
lane up which they were advancing.
His memory and his example will never
be lost to the British Army, long and
brilliant as is the roll of its heroes.</p>

<p>The strength of the four columns of
assault was 3,660 men; of the Reserve
column 1,500; or a total of 5,160. Opposed
to us was a fortress "seven miles
in circumference, filled with an immense
fanatical Mussalman population, garrisoned
by full 40,000 soldiers armed and
disciplined by ourselves, with 114 heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
pieces of artillery mounted on the walls,
with the largest magazine of shot, shell,
and ammunition in the Upper Provinces
at their disposal, besides some 60 pieces
of field artillery, all of our own manufacture,
and manned by artillerymen
drilled and taught by ourselves."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The casualties on our side that morning
were 1,145 killed and wounded. The
result of the day's fighting was that we
had forced our way into a small corner
of the City, and there "hung on by our
teeth." Slight and precarious as was
the grip which we had thus obtained on
the throat of the enemy, it yet proved
sufficient for eventual success; but there
can be no dispute that for the next forty-eight
hours the position was critical.
The great City with its intricate network
of narrow lanes crookedly piercing
through masses of lofty brick-built houses&mdash;with
its strong places such as the Magazine,
the King's Palace, Selimgurh, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the Jumma Musjid&mdash;was yet unconquered
and defiant; the roar of combat continued
without ceasing. The General, Sir
Archdale Wilson, worn out with illness
and want of rest, and with the strain of
long-continued anxiety, seemed to those
around him to be losing heart and to be
half inclined to abandon our dearly-earned
footing within the walls, and to withdraw
the troops once more to the old
position outside. Worse than all, great
stores of brandy and wine which had
been cunningly left by the rebels exposed
to the sight of our soldiers, fell into
their hands, and the inevitable result
followed. Numbers of our men eagerly
swallowed the fiery poison; and those
who had hitherto proved themselves
heroes now wallowed in the gutters,
helpless and imbecile. Most providentially
the enemy did not seize upon that
moment for a vigorous onslaught. If
they had done so it would probably have
been successful, and the British Empire
in India would have staggered under a
crushing and shameful blow from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
worst and most persistent foe of its army,
strong drink. Vigorous measures were,
however, promptly taken. Working
parties, strongly officered, were told off
to destroy the bottles and empty the
casks; and very soon all danger from this
source was averted.</p>

<p>On the 16th an important step in
advance was achieved. The magazine
was taken with trifling loss; and though
the small arms portion of it had suffered
seriously from the gallant exploit of
Willoughby, who had blown it up on
the 11th of May, great stores of artillery
munitions were found in it. Very promptly
were mortars set in position within it
to shell the Palace, which was not more
than a quarter of a mile distant. Most
interesting and beautiful was it to see
the big shells, propelled by a mere
spoonful of powder, issuing from their
wide throats; and, after performing a
slow and graceful curve, easily followed
by the naked eye, fall within the dull red
walls of the Palace. Then would be
heard a deep roar and a crash as of falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
masonry, often followed by loud
yells of hurt or dismay.</p>

<p>The next important forward move was
accomplished on the night of the 18th
and early morning of the 19th, when our
troops, steadily working their way from
house to house and enclosure to enclosure,
succeeded in seizing the Lahore
bastion. From this moment the game
was all up for the enemy. The old King
and his people had cleared out of the
Palace on the 18th, doubtless finding the
place inconveniently lively, and on the
19th a general exodus from the City must
have been accomplished.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 20th my
Commanding Officer, Captain Sanford,
was nowhere to be found. I was told that
he had last been seen riding, followed
by a single orderly, in the direction
of the City. In a moment flashed on me,
with the confidence of certainty, the
thought that he must have gone on a
scouting expedition into the City, to ascertain
how far the enemy had evacuated
it, and that he had not taken me, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
his inseparable companion, because
he did not wish to expose me to the risks
of a certainly hare-brained exploit. No
sooner had I formed this idea than I
summoned my personal orderly and went
off in search of him. When we arrived
at the City my surmise was confirmed.
Sanford and his orderly had been seen
riding in to the deserted streets beyond
our sentries. So we followed his example,
and, keeping an uncommonly bright
look-out, started on the route which he
was said to have taken. Truly the town
was abandoned. Not a living creature
did we see; but we had not gone many
hundred yards before we met Sanford,
briskly trotting back, his face radiant
with joy. He had penetrated right through
the City to the Delhi and Turkman gates
on the south, and had chalked "Guide
Cavalry" on them. With him I rode to
the quarters of Sir Archdale Wilson,
to whom he reported the fact that the
whole place was evacuated by the enemy.
Whether others had anticipated Sanford
I know not; but I do not think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
that whatever news may have been
brought in to our Intelligence Department
by native spies, any Englishman
had, before him, with his own eyes,
witnessed the fact that Delhi was at last
entirely in our power. At any rate his
daring exploit was performed exactly as
I have related it. Not many months
subsequently he lost his life, as will be
hereafter told, while undertaking, single-handed,
a not dissimilar reconnaisance.</p>

<p>During the day our troops entered into
full possession of the City. All the strong
points, the Palace, Selimgurh, the Jumma
Musjid, the bastions and the gates were
occupied by them; and the latest, and,
let us trust, the last, siege of Delhi came
to an end.</p>

<p>All is well that ends well. It is
always easy and not always unprofitable
after an event to speculate as to what
might have been the result if a different
course of action had been adopted with
the view of bringing it about. It is well
known that General Barnard, yielding to
the arguments of the ardent young officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
of Royal Engineers, Greathead,
Chesney, and Maunsell, aided by Hodson,
had sanctioned an attempt to take Delhi
by a <i>coup de main</i> on the morning of the
12th of June; and that if Brigadier
Graves, the field officer of the day, had
understood, or, understanding, had obeyed
his instructions to reinforce the attacking
column with the 1st Fusiliers,
the assault would actually have come off.
It is also known that about three weeks
afterwards the General had again all
but made up his mind to risk "the
gambler's throw," when he first hesitated,
and then decided to delay a little
longer; that then he died of cholera; and
that General Reed, who succeeded him,
was compelled by broken health, after a
few days, to resign the command into the
hands of General Archdale Wilson; and
that the latter never for a moment
dreamed of doing more than holding his
own position, far less of storming Delhi,
till he had been reinforced by every
available soldier that could be sent to
him from the Punjab, and by the heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
guns and mortars of the siege train from
Ferozepore.</p>

<p>It is certainly possible that if the intended
assault had been delivered on the
12th of June it would have been successful.
For my own part I have very little
doubt on the subject. The battles of the
Hindun Nuddee and of Badle-ka-Serai
had severely shaken the <i>morale</i> of the
enemy; and the very audacity of so daring
and so prompt an attack by the united
forces from Umballa and Meerut, each
of which had, unsupported by the other,
won so signal a victory, would have
struck terror into the rebels and probably
insured their defeat. On the other
hand, the prospects of success three
weeks later were not so hopeful. In the
interval our numbers had not augmented,
while those of the enemy had received
considerable accessions. They had materially
strengthened their defences; and
had probably regained confidence in
themselves.</p>

<p>Granting, however, that we would have
succeeded in storming the walls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
even&mdash;far harder task&mdash;in driving the
enemy out of the City with our handful of
troops, would our position then have been
better and stronger than the one we held
on the Ridge? Would our two thousand
bayonets have been adequate to occupy a
circle of walls seven miles in length
against an army of at least forty thousand
men? For it may be presumed that
as brigade after brigade and contingent
after contingent mutinied they would
have rolled together and attempted the
recapture of the seat of the Moghul Empire.
On the other hand, would the
early fall of Delhi have prevented the
further spread of revolt, and, if so, would
that have been an unmixed good; or was
it better that the full measure of the latent
disaffection should be allowed to
reveal itself and be once for all effectually
stamped out? Such are the problems
which will occur to a thoughtful mind
and which cannot with certainty be
solved.</p>

<p>The story of the capture of the old
King and of the slaughter of the Princes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by Hodson is too well-known to need
repetition.</p>

<p>During the next few weeks nothing
more eventful occurred within the walls
of Delhi than the doings of the prize
agents&mdash;from the point of view, at any
rate, of a needy subaltern who looked to
them for the replenishment of a purse
which had been well nigh emptied by
the incendiary fires at Meerut.</p>

<p>The first column to be detached on
external operations was the one under
Colonel Greathead of the 8th King's,
which moved southwards with the view
of attacking and breaking up any retreating
bodies of the enemy which it
might overtake; and which, early in October,
so opportunely effected the relief
of Agra, and gained so glorious a victory
over the Indore contingent and the other
rebel troops which were moving to the
assault of that place. Another column
under Brigadier-General Showers was
subsequently sent into the districts to the
west and north-west, and to this the
Guide Cavalry was attached. Our chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
object was to punish, and, if possible,
capture the Nawab of Jhujjur; but before
effecting this we moved about the country,
"showing our muscle," to use a slang
phrase, and thereby dispersing stray
bands of marauders, and instilling confidence
into the quietly disposed people of
the agricultural classes.</p>

<p>During the suppression of the Mutiny,
a campaign which was unique and unlike
any other, the iron bands of discipline
were, in some respects, not so tightly
drawn as usual, and many things happened
which would now be impossible.
For instance, it was not at all unheard of
for an enterprising officer, with no other
sanction than that of his commanding
officer, to take a small party of mounted
men and start off on the prowl in search
of adventures. Very frequently he found
them, and took good care, in view of the
irregularity of his proceedings, that no
report of them reached the General. On
some such occasion, a captain who was
doing duty with us, and who was well-known
for his eccentricity, almost verging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
on insanity, his fearlessness, and his
unsparing thirst for vengeance against
the mutineers, found himself, with a
squad of sixteen or twenty men, many
miles from camp, in front of the gateway
of a walled enclosure, inside which were
about forty rebel sepoys who, relying on
their distance from danger, had taken no
precautions against surprise, and were
quietly cooking their dinner. H&mdash;&mdash; took
in the situation at once. "Halt!" he
shouted in a stentorian voice, to his men,
adding in Hindustani "Only twenty men
follow me into the gate. Let the rest of
the regiment remain outside." "Throw
down your arms in that corner," he roared
to the terror-stricken sepoys. "Gather
together in the opposite corner, and be
quick about it, or I will slay you all."
He was immediately obeyed. "Now,"
said he, "I see among you a number of
men older than the others, whom they
have probably led astray. Drive them
out from among you, that I may destroy
them." The miserable cowards of young
men instantly thrust out the older ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
struggling and fighting for dear life: and
H&mdash;&mdash; and his party fell on them and
killed them.</p>

<p>Then turning to the traitorous remnant,
"What dirt have you eaten! Oh children
of owls!" and he "smote them also, hip
and thigh."</p>

<p>Before utterly and unreservedly condemning
this undoubtedly savage action,
I would beg the reader to remember that
in this Mutiny war no quarter was given
on either side. We looked, and rightly
looked, upon the mutineers, not as honest
enemies, but as foul and cruel murderers
for whom to die by the sword was too
good a fate, and whose only fit end was
on the gallows. If they had confined
themselves to a revolt against the Government,
and in attempting it had
slaughtered their officers and all men
who tried to suppress it, they would not
have placed themselves outside the pale
of mercy; but since they had butchered
our defenceless women and children, we
would have been more than human, we
would have been less than men, if we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
not exterminated them as men kill snakes
whenever we met them. H&mdash;&mdash; well knew
that if he did not destroy these sepoys
they would destroy him. The slightest
hesitation on his part, and they would
have sprung to arms, and being caught
like rats in a trap, would have fought
with the energy of despair. Their muskets
against our men's swords would have
given their superior numbers a decisive
advantage. We should undoubtedly have
lost several men, and would probably
have been driven back. From this nothing
but the prompt and clever strategy
adopted by H&mdash;&mdash; saved his party. With
all this, it is impossible to avoid a feeling
of regret that this incident should have
occurred.</p>

<h2>V.<br />
CAPTURE OF JHUJJUR.</h2>


<p>One evening, as my Commanding
Officer, Captain Sanford, and I, after dining
at mess, returned to the tent which
we shared between us, he told me that I
need not expect to enjoy that night a
very long rest; for he had planned a
little expedition on which I was to accompany
him. He had got information
from a spy of the whereabouts of a
small body of the enemy at a village
about twelve miles from our camp. He
had already given orders for fifty of our
men who had been separately and secretly
told off to arm themselves and mount
their horses as quietly as possible soon
after midnight, and sneak out of camp,
one by one, through a picquet which had
been warned to let them pass. He had
taken none of the officers except myself
and the Adjutant into his confidence,
partly to escape their importunities to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
be allowed to accompany us, and partly
because there was no certainty that we
might not be going on a wild goose chase.
At the stroke of midnight we arose, dressed
and armed ourselves, fortified our
stomachs with a cup of hot tea, crammed
into our holsters a cold roast fowl apiece
and some chapatties, mounted our horses
and stole out of camp to the rendezvous,
where we found our party and a guide
waiting for us. Placing the guide in
front under the escort of a couple of sowars,
and whispering to the men on the
right flank to follow in single file, Sanford
noiselessly led the way. Not till
we had placed a couple of miles between
ourselves and camp did we halt, form
up, and "tell off," after which necessary
proceeding we continued our journey,
stumbling along in the dark over fields
and by foot-paths till our guide intimated
that we were within a mile of our
destination. As it was still an hour or
so before dawn we now halted, dismounted,
looked to our girths, and loosened
our swords in their scabbards. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
we again moved on, preceded by a few
scouts, with whom was the guide, the
very faintest flush of light was beginning
to suffuse the sky in the east. In a few
minutes more the darkness of night had
partially rolled away; and we could see,
not far to our front, a group of thatched
roofs, and a few tiny curls of blue smoke
where some early risers had begun their
preparations for breakfast. Almost at
the same moment we came across two
or three sepoys who had thus early come
out into the field. Short shrift had they.
We pressed on; and then a carbine shot
broke the stillness, followed by the clattering
of horses' hoofs, as a small picquet,
which&mdash;strange to say&mdash;had actually
been posted on the look-out, took the
alarm and galloped away.</p>

<p>After them we went, <i>ventre a terre</i>, and
drove them right into the village, which
turned out to be a small one, and not in
any way protected by earthworks. From
the complete absence of any attempt at
checking us by musketry fire, coupled
with the uproar within the hamlet, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
evident that our sudden attack had smitten
its defenders with panic; so Sanford
with his usual boldness promptly decided
to strike while the iron was hot. Detaching
two small squads to sweep round
the place and join us on the opposite
side, he led the main party at a gallop
straight up the main street, and through
the village, into the fields beyond, which
were already full of fugitives. They were
all mounted, but many of them had been
in such a hurry to bolt that they had not
had time to saddle their horses. Though
they were two or three times our number,
and&mdash;if they had kept a really efficient
look-out, could easily have beaten us off&mdash;they
were so completely demoralised by
terror that they did not make the slightest
effort to rally, but fled in all directions,
each man for himself, and each
trying to make the fastest time on record.
It may be imagined what a holiday this
was for our fierce "Guides." Soon was
the plain strewn with the bodies of their
victims; and though many of the rebels
when overtaken used their <i>tulwars</i> as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
well as they could, they only succeeded
in slightly wounding a few of our men.</p>

<p>One unfortunate fellow, who fell to my
lot, threw himself off his horse when I
had nearly overtaken him, and boldly
facing me on foot, tried to draw his <i>tulwar</i>;
but the more he tugged the less
would it leave the scabbard. For a moment
I thought fear had paralysed his
arm; but I discovered afterwards that he
had tied his hilt to the scabbard, and in
his hurry and very natural agitation had
forgotten all about the fastening. It was
not at all an unusual practice with native
swordsmen to thus fasten up their <i>tulwars</i>,
with the view of preventing their keen
edges from getting blunted by friction.</p>

<p>For three or four miles we kept up
the pursuit, when Sanford sounded the
"halt" and "rally" and our scattered
men gradually obeyed the summons,
and assembled, many of them
leading captured horses, and laden with
loot in the shape of arms and odds and
ends, among which were doubtless many
gold mohurs and rupees extracted from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the <i>cummerbunds</i> of the fallen sowars.
Very unobtrusive was our return into
camp that evening. Not till after dusk
did we sneak in as we had sneaked out,
by ones and twos; for we were by no
means anxious that the General should
come to hear of our unsanctioned escapade,
till, at any rate, Sanford had found
time to think over the most judicious excuse
for it.</p>

<p>As we stretched our tired legs under
the table in the mess tent, and refreshed
our dry throats with a welcome draught
of "tarbund" beer, we looked forward
to a good night's rest after our day's
adventures, for the force was not to resume
its march till daylight next morning.
At this juncture an official letter
was brought by an orderly and handed
to the commanding officer, whose face
while he read it presented an interesting
study. He ended its perusal with a low
whistle clearly indicative of puzzled embarrassment;
and then communicated
its contents to the table. The staff officer
of the column had, it seemed, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
honour to inform him that the General
had received information that a certain
village&mdash;the very one we had paid our
morning call at&mdash;was occupied by a strong
outpost of the enemy's cavalry. Captain
Sanford was desired to take all the
available sabres of his regiment and
beat up that outpost, timing his march
so as, if possible, to effect a surprise
about the break of day. In the event of
the enemy proving too strong to be dislodged
Captain Sanford was to communicate
with the General, who would be
found on the line of march previously
notified in Orders. Here was a pretty
dilemma; what was to be done now? It
would never do at this stage of the affair
to report that we had anticipated the
General both in information and in acting
on it. He would have been furious,
so our commanding officer contented
himself with acknowledging the receipt
of the order. Once more, soon after
midnight, we turned out, this time the
whole Regiment, some 250 strong; and
marched away in the same direction as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
on the previous night. Our spirits were
not quite so lively as on that occasion,
and Sanford was not so gay as usual;
for he did not quite see his way out of
the scrape he had got into.</p>

<p>At daylight we reached the village,
now apparently deserted; and here we
met with a wonderful stroke of luck: for
in one of the houses we captured a foolish
fellow, who, after escaping us the day
before, had, thinking the coast was clear,
come back in the night to recover some
things which he had not had the leisure
to pack up before taking his leave. The
poor fellow's surprise was painful to witness;
but he soon brightened up when
he was promised his life on condition
that he conducted us to the place where
his comrades had taken refuge. This he
undertook to do; and, to ensure his fidelity,
his hands were securely tied together,
and he was mounted on a stray
pony, the leading rope of which was
given in charge to a couple of men who
had orders to shoot him if he attempted
to escape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>He said that about six miles further
we would find most of his comrades, who
had established a bivouac in the open,
for they had apparently had enough of
village enclosures. His information proved
perfectly correct. Directly the enemy
saw our scouts they made off in an even
greater hurry, if possible, than before.
During the pursuit we, as usual, got a
good deal scattered. Presently I observed
two figures, far away to the left, disappearing
into the distance, while behind
them, at a long interval, was riding Captain
Sanford, followed by a few men.
After him I galloped as hard as I could
go. When at last I overtook him I found
him and his party halted at the gate of a
"serai," inside which were about fifty
sowars of the Jhujjur troops, with their
horses picketed to pegs, and&mdash;best prize
of all&mdash;two light brass guns.</p>

<p>The two figures I had first seen were
one of the enemy pursued by a non-commissioned
officer of ours who was generally
known as the "Shahzada," and
who was suspected of not being gifted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
with an excess of courage. The reader
will judge, however, whether the suspicion
was well founded. In the pursuit
he had singled out one of the enemy,
who, being nearly as well mounted as
himself, had led him a long chase across
country; but he had stuck to him till he
ran him to earth in the serai, at the gate
of which the Shahzada had to pull up,
for it was full of "moofsids." Nothing
daunted, he had produced from his belt
an enormous horse pistol, covered the
lot with it in a general sort of way, informed
them that the "Guide Rissala"&mdash;name
of terror to the rebels&mdash;was close
at his heels, and threatened to drill a
hole into the first man who stirred. The
cowardly crew, who had doubtless heard
all about the previous day's surprise and
slaughter, were too frightened to move.
In a few moments Sanford and his men
reinforced the Shahzada; and when I
rode up were all keeping guard at the
gate. Before long we were joined by the
main body of the regiment; and then
the prisoners were secured; their horses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
seized; and Sanford, with a light heart,
sat down to indite a short despatch to
the General, informing him that we had
captured fifty prisoners and two brass
guns. This was sent off without loss
of time; and we commenced our march
to rejoin the column; but we were met
by an order to stay where we were, as
the column would come to us. So we
retraced our steps to the serai. Whether
Captain Sanford, on the General's arrival,
made a clean breast of it, and told
him the whole story of the previous day's
affair or not, I know not. At any rate,
we never heard anything more about it.</p>

<p>A capture of horses was always welcome,
for that was the only way in which
we could replace casualties among our
own mounts; and casualties were pretty
frequent in those days from wounds and
hard work. We used to select the best
of the captives and pass them into the
ranks; and sell by auction in camp the
others and those whom we rejected from
among our own animals. Hitherto we
had always considered such prize of war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
our own perquisites; and no one had interfered
with us. It now happened, however,
that a levy of mounted police was
being raised; and this batch of horses
was requisitioned for them. We were,
much to our disgust, obliged to part with
some of them; but I have a shrewd idea
that many of the best remained picketed
in our lines. For my own part I was
determined to stick to a very handsome
roan mare of which I had relieved her
former owner, after putting it out of his
power to ride her or any other mare any
more. Whether the officer to whom the
captured animals were to have been
made over suspected that some were kept
back or exchanged for "screws," I cannot
say; but we heard that one of the prisoners
was to be sent round our lines to
identify them. Before he came the roan
mare had been carefully groomed, her
mane and tail dressed, my military saddle
and bridle fitted on her, and a blanket
thrown carelessly over the saddle and
her loins. Very charger-like she looked,
and very unlike what she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
an hour before. The prisoner when he
came on his visit of inspection did not
even look at her, but fixed his eyes on a
grey Arab, for which I had given a long
price some months previously, and after
pretending to eye him critically all over,
confidently declared that he was one of
the captured horses. Such a transparent
mistake effectually discredited his evidence;
and he was turned out of our
lines with ignominy. Many a hard day's
work did that roan mare do afterwards;
and I daresay she served the State as
well when carrying an officer of Irregular
Cavalry as she would have done if
she had joined the new levy.</p>

<p>That mare was the only "loot" that
I allowed myself to take during the Mutiny
campaign; and as she was literally
the "captive of my bow and spear," in
so far as these weapons were represented
by a Wilkinson blade, I cannot feel that
I was very much to blame for keeping
her. On at least one occasion, however, I
was sorely tempted. We had taken possession
of a deserted town; and our men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
were busily "searching for arms," a euphemism
which covered the quest for
many more valuable articles, when I rode
into a courtyard under a gate so low that
I had to cling to my horse's neck to avoid
breaking my own. As I crossed the yard
to where a group of my brother officers
was standing, one of my horse's feet sunk
deep into the ground, which was elsewhere
as hard as a stone pavement. This
was a sufficient hint to us to dig: and dig
we did without delay. Imagine our
excitement when, at a depth of two or
three feet, we came upon the lid of a
large iron chest. Some of our men had
been helping us with native spades
and hoes which had been left lying
about in the huts; and we now placed
a couple of them on sentry at the gate
to warn off intruders, while we redoubled
our labours, and before long had
lifted the heavy chest out of its hole. It
was locked, and for a time defied all our
efforts to break it open. While this was
being done, the ever vigilant Father of
Evil took advantage of his opportunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
There could be no doubt that the chest,
so carefully hidden, must be full of barbaric
gold and gems. Why should we
hand all this wealth over to the prize
agents? Their operations were confined to
Delhi. This village was clearly outside
their sphere. They and their employés
would never come near it. But for us
the chest would never have been discovered.
While thoughts such as these
were being freely expressed and eagerly
discussed the lid of the box was somehow
or other forced open; and then was
revealed&mdash;a mass of documents, quantities
of papers bearing revenue stamps,
numbers of unused stamps, and absolutely
nothing else. These papers, though
worthless to us, were yet of great importance
and value, as we were informed by
the political officers to whom they were
made over.</p>

<p>After all "auld Clootie" had not wasted
his time. He had succeeded in making
some of us feel the power of a good solid
temptation; and I daresay had a quiet
laugh in his sleeve at our disappointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in not being permitted to succumb
to it.</p>

<p>In this same deserted town a certain
"Chobdar," a kind of Oriental "gold
stick" of the old King's was suspected to
be in hiding; and as he was particularly
"wanted" by Sir John Metcalfe, the
officer in political charge of Delhi, we
instituted a very vigorous search for him.
A young native lad had been won over
by the blandishments of H&mdash;&mdash; to conduct
us to a group of huts in one of which he
asserted we should surely find the object
of our quest. For an hour or more we
hunted without success, when, in a small
dark room, I noticed one of the large
mud-built jars in which natives store
their grain. This is, to describe it roughly,
a section of a tube closed at both ends,
about three feet in diameter and five or
six feet high, and stands upright on one
end. Near the top a circular hole is cut
in the side, into which the grain is poured,
and a lid is fitted on to this hole. Possibly
Morgiana and the forty thieves flashed
across my mind. At any rate I removed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the lid, and shoving the muzzle of my
revolver into the reservoir, requested its
possible occupant to come out. The
pistol certainly struck against something
which yielded. So I thrust in my
arm and caught hold of&mdash;a thick beard.
A long pull and a strong pull&mdash;and out
came the Chobdar at full length!</p>

<p>I made him over to my commanding
officer, who delivered him up to the political
authorities, who, for doubtless sufficient
reasons, hanged him on a branch
of a tree.</p>

<p>At length came the time when we were
to try conclusions with the Nawab of
Jhujjur. That rebel Chief was waiting
for us at home in his capital, where he
had collected a considerable force.</p>

<p>One day, after a long march which had
brought our column within a few miles
of Jhujjur, we, the Guides Cavalry and a
body of Irregular Horse under Captain
Pearse, were not a little disgusted by
the receipt of orders to retrace our steps
at once to a point not far from whence
we had just come. To the subaltern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mind there seemed no sense in this arrangement;
and as our commanding
officer did not enlighten us as to the
reason for it, we grumbled a good deal
as we hurriedly watered and fed our
horses, and then started on the weary
return march.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon we had arrived
at our destination, and were then warned
to be in readiness to march again
soon after midnight. Just before dark I
had strolled a few hundred yards from
camp by myself and was returning, when
I was suddenly confronted among some
low rolling sandhills by a "sowari"
camel carrying two native riders. To
present my revolver at them and call on
them to halt took about a second; and
so taken aback were they that they obeyed
at once. I then made them dismount
and lead their camel before me to camp.
Far better would it have been for them
if they had risked my fire and tried to
escape; for on them was found a letter
which they were carrying to the Jhujjur
Nawab, and which contained the news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
our movements and a guess at our strength.
They paid the penalty which in all wars
is exacted from spies. As things turned
out their capture were a most fortunate
accident; for when, in the darkness of
the night, our small force of sabres paraded
for the march, we were for the first
time informed of the reason for our eccentric
movements. It seemed that General
Showers intended to attack Jhujjur that
morning from the opposite side to that
where we were now posted. His having
taken us with him and then sent us back
was a <i>ruse de guerre</i>, the object of which
the reader will easily divine. He thought
it more than probable that the Nawab
and his troops when they were driven
out of Jhujjur would&mdash;thinking the coast
was clear in our direction&mdash;take that
route to another strong place which lay
behind us, and that they would fall into
our hands.</p>

<p>We were warned to make as little
noise as possible, and were strictly forbidden
to smoke. We had a good many
miles to cover before getting near Jhujjur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
so we moved off in column of route.
Shortly before dawn we heard a distant
voice gaily singing and gradually becoming
louder as it approached us. The
minstrel proved to be one of a small
party of sowars who must have been the
most egregious cowards of the Jhujjur
garrison, for they had evidently fled
long before any one else; and were
doubtless congratulating themselves on
their timely escape from the fierce "Feringhis"
when to their horror they found
themselves in our midst. A few swift
flashes of steel and their songs were over
for ever.</p>

<p>The day began gradually to break as
we pushed eagerly on, meeting at intervals
other small parties, of whom not one
escaped, though some made a desperate
fight for life. At length, just before the
sun rose, as we neared the summit of
some rising ground which we were ascending,
our scouts galloped back with
news that the main body of the fugitives
was within sight. We at once formed
line to the front in rank entire, a formation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
which I may explain for the benefit
of civilian readers, is composed of only
one rank instead of two, and which, of
course, doubles the extent of front; for
our leader wished to frighten the enemy
by an imposing show of force, rightly
judging that at a distance they would
not see that we had no rear rank. Our
line advanced to the crest of the high
ground, and then burst on our view a
sight which can never be forgotten.</p>

<p>A gentle slope stretched away from
us, ending in a wide plain which was
covered with a huge crowd moving towards
us in a disorderly mob. Fighting
men on horse-back and on foot&mdash;on camels&mdash;on
a stray elephant or two&mdash;in bullock
carts and "ekkas"&mdash;without any show
of discipline or regular formation, mingled
with hundreds of non-combatants
all pressing tumultuously onwards.</p>

<p>For a moment our long line halted full
in view of the enemy. Then rang out the
commands "Prepare to draw swords."&mdash;"Draw
swords." Our sabres flashed into
light, gleaming in the rays of the rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
sun. "Forward at a walk;" "March;"
"Trot;" "Gallop;" "Charge." Down
the slope we thundered. Like the sands
on a dry plain struck by a sudden squall
the dense mob before us with a wild cry
of despair, broke into fragments and
fled&mdash;in vain! Our impetus carried us
into the midst of them. For miles we
pursued them, and heavy was the loss
we inflicted on those who bore arms.</p>

<p>Theoretically, cavalry should at all
times be kept well in hand and under
perfect control. Practically, it would be
quite as easy to bind the winds after they
had burst out of the bag of Æolus, as to
control cavalry once launched in pursuit.
What else could possibly be expected?
The enemy, if mounted, scatters in flight
in all directions, and at racing pace. If
they are to be overtaken and destroyed
the pursuers also must scatter, and at
still greater speed. A very few minutes
will cover miles of country with a rapidly
extending fan of more or less isolated
swiftly-moving groups. Such, at any rate,
was our frequent experience during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Mutiny campaigns. The only remedy
would have been to have invariably kept
a strong reserve; but this precaution
was, with such contemptible antagonists,
hardly necessary. After the first few
trials of strength the rebels had thoroughly
learned the lesson that an encounter
with our troops in the open field invariably
meant defeat, and that the consequences
of defeat were terrible. Having no real
discipline or organisation, and no confidence
in their leaders, they always met
us with what may be best described
as nervous hesitation; and their promptitude
in bolting was often astonishing.
Frequently would individuals and small
knots of men turn to bay and fight manfully;
but usually not till they also had
yielded to the general impulse of panic,
and had joined for a time in the stampede.</p>

<p>In this pursuit I had the good fortune
to kill a mutineer who must undoubtedly
have been concerned in the murder of
some European, for I found on him a
gold mourning ring bearing on the circlet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in black enamelled letters, the words
"In memory of." The stone, which
evidently must have been inscribed with
some name, was missing. The wretch
made no fight, but died like a cur, with
my blade through his back. Observing
that his <i>cummerbund</i> bulged considerably,
I unrolled it; and out of its folds fell
a quantity of rupees and other things,
among which was the ring, which I took,
leaving the rest of the loot for any one
who might be inclined to pick it up. I
placed the ring on one of my fingers,
resolving, when the opportunity should
offer, to have a bloodstone inserted in it,
with the date 1857.</p>

<p>To my great regret, later in the day, I
found that the ring, which was rather
loose for my finger, had slipped off it,
and was lost.</p>

<p>It will be admitted that when we joined
the rendezvous at Jhujjur we had,
during the past forty-eight hours, done
a fair share of work; but more was in
store for us. The Nawab was a prisoner
in the hands of the General, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
decided to send him without delay to
head-quarters at Delhi; and we were
ordered to escort him. Accordingly in
the afternoon the Nawab, who was a
heavy, corpulent man, was placed in a
doolie provided with a large number of
bearers; and once more our tired horses
were on the move. I forget what was
the distance between Jhujjur and Delhi;
but I well remember that the march was
a very long and fatiguing one; and that
it was not before the dawn of next day
that we had finished it, and were able to
hand our prisoner over to other custodians.</p>

<p>He was duly tried, found guilty, and
hanged in the Chandni Chowk, the principal
street of Delhi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>




<h2>VI.<br />
EN ROUTE FOR LUCKNOW.</h2>


<p>About this time I seized an opportunity
of getting a few days' leave to run over
to Meerut. Soon after my return the
Corps of Guides which, since its arrival
in the camp before Delhi after its famous
forced march from the far frontier,
had continuously rendered services not
eclipsed by any other troops which had
the honour to take part in the siege, received
orders to return to Hoti Murdan.
Its losses, both in the cavalry and infantry
branches of the regiment, had been
so numerous that it became absolutely
necessary to fill their places with recruits.</p>

<p>To my deep sorrow my connection
with this distinguished regiment then
came to an end; but while I live it will
always be a source of pride to me to have
been privileged to serve with it, even for
so short a time, during the memorable
siege of Delhi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Delhi had fallen and the
Punjab was secure, the revolt was yet
far from having been suppressed in the
Provinces of the North-West and Oudh.
There was still plenty of service to be
seen in those parts; and I was naturally
anxious to find my way down to them.
In those days it was fortunately not very
difficult to get to the front when any
fighting was to be done. There was
work for every one, and plenty of it.
Since then, many a keen soldier not
possessed of influential friends at head-quarters,
has had to be content to find
himself shut out from the series of "little
wars," so prolific of medals and decorations
and brevet promotion, which seem
providentially provided for the swift advancement
in the service of his more
fortunate comrades who are equipped
with that best of military qualifications&mdash;"interest."</p>

<p>Not to digress, however, the opportunity
was afforded me of getting transferred
to the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry,
a corps which had been newly raised in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
the Punjab by the late Captain Wale,
and was commanded by him; and which
about this time arrived at Delhi <i>en route</i>
to join Sir Colin Campbell's forces in the
south. That regiment began, under
Wale, a distinguished career which it
continued under Probyn in China. It is
now the 11th Prince of Wales's Own
Bengal Lancers, and still maintains its
high reputation among the many splendid
regiments which compose the Bengal
and Punjab Cavalry; a force of horsemen
which, it is safe to say, is not excelled,
as regards all the best qualities of
light cavalry, by any troops in the world.</p>

<p>If the smart 11th Bengal Lancers
could see themselves as they appeared
when, as the 1st Sikh Irregulars, they
marched down the grand trunk road
from Delhi in the winter of 1857, they
would be not a little amused and astonished.
Every variety of bit, bridle, saddle
<i>tulwar</i>&mdash;every variety of horse, entire,
mare, and gelding,&mdash;of all heights, from
15 hands to animals little bigger than
ponies. Such were the equipment and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the mounting of the regiment; and our
notions of drill were at first equally primitive.
It was all we could do to "form
threes right" or "left." The men, however&mdash;if
no two of them rode alike, and
none of them had a "cavalry seat"&mdash;were
undeniable horsemen; and there was
never any difficulty in getting them,
when an enemy was before them, to
form some sort of a line to the front, and
to ride as hard and as straight, if not
with quite as good "dressing," as the
better drilled troops of the present day.</p>

<p>On our first march from Delhi a comical
incident, which, however, might
easily have turned out rather a serious
one, occurred. I was riding with the
advanced files, when a young native
woman, wielding with both hands a very
long straight double-edged sword, such
as is frequently used by acrobats at
Indian festivities, suddenly appeared in
the middle of the road and barred our
way. The creature must have been mad
or under the influence of "bhang" or
some other intoxicant; for she deluged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
us with a torrent of abuse as she vigorously
brandished the long thin blade.
For a moment I was nonplussed: the
situation was so entirely novel! Mad or
sane, the virago evidently meant business.
There was clearly no getting past
her without a fight; and that was quite
out of the question.</p>

<p>"Shoot her, sahib," said one of the
sowars with me, little troubled with the
polite consideration for the sex which
the obligations of an effete civilisation
imposed upon his British officer. At
that moment, as if by inspiration, a
"happy thought" flashed on my mind.
"Give her <i>galee</i>," (abuse) I said to the
sowar; "and give it her hot and strong,
and plenty of it." Instantly grasping the
idea, the grinning sowar opened such a
battery of abuse of the vilest and most
comprehensive nature upon the unfortunate
young person and her female relatives
to the remotest degree that her
own fire was promptly silenced. Encouraged
by this success, the sowar redoubled
his efforts; and slung such awful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
shameful language with such force and
precision that the rout of the enemy speedily
became complete. Dropping her long
sword and stuffing her fingers into her
ears, she fled with a horrified shriek;
and we marched triumphantly on, chuckling
at the success of our tactics.</p>

<p>Nothing very exciting occurred during
the long, dusty march to Cawnpore. For
a considerable part of the way we had to
escort an immense train of empty bullock
carts, destined for the use of Sir
Colin's army; and our duties were monotonous
in the extreme. Heartily would
we have welcomed an attack on our convoy;
but none was ever made.</p>

<p>At Cawnpore I was left in command of
a detachment of fifty sabres, while the
head-quarters of the regiment went on
to Alumbagh, near Lucknow. This was
a grievous disappointment to me; but
as things turned out, nothing more lucky
could have happened.</p>

<p>After having marched here and there
about the country with a column under
Brigadier-General Cardew, during which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
time nothing worth record occurred, we
returned to Cawnpore and remained
there for a while. My comrade and
fellow-subaltern at that time was Lieutenant
now (Colonel) Sir Robert Sandeman,
<i>K.C.S.I.</i>, to whose wisdom and
tact and perseverance India owes her
present impregnable frontier on the
North-West, and the gradual conversion
of the wild tribes of Baluchistan into
friendly and peaceful communities. He
and I one day rode out to visit our friends,
the 3rd Battalion of the Rifle Brigade,
at Unao, on the Lucknow road, where
they were encamped under the command
of Colonel Macdonell. While there the
Colonel took me aside and informed me
that a messenger had just come in with
an urgent request for help from a village
some few miles to the north, which was
held by a small detachment of police.
The village which, like most others in
Oudh at that date, was fortunately protected
by a strong and lofty mud-built
wall, was attacked by a force of some
hundreds of rebels; and unless speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
relieved its defenders were in danger of
running short of ammunition. It was
promptly arranged that Sandeman and
I should gallop back to Cawnpore, report
the state of affairs to General Sir John
Inglis, and obtain his permission to bring
our detachment as quickly as possible
across country to a point about three
miles from the threatened post, where we
were to join a couple of companies of the
Rifle Brigade and proceed to its relief.</p>

<p>Off we set as fast as our horses could
carry us. It was late in the evening
when we arrived; Sandeman going
straight to our lines to turn out our men,
while I went to the Fort and obtained
an interview with Sir John Inglis.</p>

<p>He was at first apparently disinclined
to let so young an officer take a detachment
at night so far from support into
the wilds; but at last he listened to my
arguments, and after impressing on me
that I was to act under the orders of
Colonel Macdonell, allowed me to go.</p>

<p>When I got to the lines I found the
men already mounted and "told off,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
and fresh horses ready for Sandeman
and myself: so that we got under way
at once. After crossing the bridge of
boats we struck across country in a slanting
direction to the left of the road.
Night had fallen, but we had the advantage
of a certain amount of moonlight,
and were able to move pretty rapidly.
When we arrived at the rendezvous there
were no signs of Colonel Macdonell or
his rifles; but a letter from him was put
into my hands by a native messenger,
who said that the Colonel, after starting
from Unao, had gone back there on
hearing that at nightfall the rebels had
raised the siege of the village, and had
retired to another some miles away. This
after our long journey to Cawnpore and
back was a terrible disappointment.</p>

<p>Possibly, however, the Colonel might
have thought it undesirable to follow the
enemy so great a distance with infantry,
and might wish me to do so with my
troop. The thought no sooner struck me
than its "sweet reasonableness" began
to grow on me; and I had very soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
persuaded myself that the yet unopened
missive contained instructions which
chimed with my wishes. Unfortunately,
however, it was too dark to read the
letter without a light, and I had no matches!
Neither, very curiously, had Sandeman!
At any rate, we did not find
any in our pockets: so we held a short
council of war; and decided that in the
absence of instructions, we felt it our
duty to proceed to the lately beleaguered
village, and learn all we could about the
movements of the enemy. We took the
messenger with us as a guide, and in
another hour had reached our destination.</p>

<p>The brave defenders were delighted to
see us; but they informed us that the
rebels had not gone far, and would certainly
return in the morning; and they
implored us not to leave them to their
fate.</p>

<p>On inquiring how many fighting men
they could muster, we found that they
could turn out about a hundred muskets
and matchlocks of sorts. I then asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
them what they thought was the strength
of the enemy. About five or six hundred
they said. Allowing for Oriental exaggeration,
we guessed that two hundred
and fifty or three hundred would probably
be nearer the mark; so I asked them
if they were game to accompany us and
beat up their late assailants, whom we
would certainly find quite unprepared
for our midnight visit. With the greatest
alacrity they agreed: so, without loss of
time, I made my dispositions, and formed
up my little army in the order
which it was to keep till the moment of
attack. In the centre I managed with
some difficulty to get the police and the
armed villagers to arrange themselves
in a line, impressing on them that if they
could keep that formation till we came
in contact with the enemy, they would
certainly be mistaken for a company of
the dreaded <i>gora logue</i> (white troops),
which would be a heavy score in our
favour. My own party I divided into
two bodies of 25 sabres each and placed
one on each flank, giving the command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
of the left to Lieutenant Sandeman and
of the right to a native officer, till the
moment of the charge, when I proposed
to lead it. I then explained the plan of
attack, and took very good care that
every man of my motley allies thoroughly
understood it, and appreciated the
extreme necessity of adhering to it. A
guide was placed in front of the centre
of the line, where I took up my position;
and he was ordered to lead me straight
to the camp of the rebels, who, we were
assured, would be found "en bivouac"
close to a village about three miles away.
The very strictest silence was enjoined
on all. As my object was to surprise the
enemy and fall on him without giving
him the slightest hint of our approach,
I did not send forward a single scout.
The line was to advance quietly and
steadily, till I should give a loud "Hurrah,"
which was to be the signal for the
police and village heroes to "loose off"
every musket they had, and to yell with
all their lungs, when the cavalry from both
flanks would charge, also with a shout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>If all that did not freeze the marrow
in the bones of a lot of sleepy Pandies,
I flattered myself nothing would!</p>

<p>So we moved off over the fields&mdash;the
soft earth muffling all sound&mdash;my improvised
infantry keeping a really wonderful
line&mdash;and all as eager as panthers.</p>

<p>In an hour or so the guide whispered
to me that we were close on our quarry,
but nothing was to be seen. The night,
though not pitch-dark, was sufficiently
so to obscure all objects beyond thirty or
forty yards. Most fortunately a belt of
trees was now behind us, which must
have effectually prevented us from being
seen from our front. Suddenly I became
aware of the <i>silhouette</i> of a man's figure
against the sky of the horizon before me,
slowly moving, apparently along the top
of a low wall. Almost at the same
instant from the dim figure came a loud
challenge:&mdash;"Hookumdar!" He must
have been startled by some sound, for
he could not have seen us.</p>

<p>I held my breath, for I feared that my
villagers might get excited, and spoil my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
plans by beginning to fire; but they behaved
admirably and crept steadily on.
Now we were within forty yards of the
sentry. "Hookumdar!" he shouted
again. For a few yards more we crouched
forward, when the sentry, now thoroughly
alarmed, once more roared
"Hookumdar," and fired his musket.
Now was the moment! I gave the signal
"Hurrah" as loud as my lungs would let
me, and galloped off to my squad of
sowars, while the line of villagers simultaneously
let off all their fire-arms, and
burst into an uproar of wild yells to
which the worst efforts of a pack of
mad jackals would have been a feeble
joke.</p>

<p>A few seconds covered the ground between
us and the rebel bivouac, and
brought us up to a shallow ditch and a
low wall, which, though they brought
down one or two of our horses, did not
for a moment check the furious charge.
So complete was the surprise and so
utterly unprepared for, that beyond a
few scattered musket shots fired off harmlessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
in panic, not the very slightest
effort at a stand was made. The wretched
Pandies as they jumped up, half
dazed with sleep, from the ground and
off the charpoys on which they had been
lying, must have been utterly bewildered
by the fiendish yells and the roar of
musketry which for many of them was
their last "reveille;" and they fled helter-skelter
in all directions into the fields,
pursued and mercilessly slain by the
Sikh horsemen, whose scanty numbers
their fears must have magnified a hundredfold.
Some were actually sabred on
the ground before they were well awake.
Others were caught before they had got
a dozen yards away; and in a few
minutes the surrounding fields were covered
with the bodies of many more; while
the lucky survivors, favoured by the
darkness, made off at best speed to unknown
and distant parts, and doubtless
had a gruesome tale to unfold when at
last they reached some safe asylum, as to
how they had escaped by the favour of
God and by the skin of their teeth, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
performing prodigies of unavailing valour,
from a midnight attack by the whole
British army.</p>

<p>The darkness made it inadvisable to
push the pursuit very far, more especially
as the defeat of the rebels was so decisive
that there was practically no danger
of their recovering from it and making
any effort to rally, and it was very certain
that they would not for some time trust
themselves in our part of the country,
far less attempt to renew the attack on
the police outpost. So I re-assembled the
troop, and was happy to find that beyond
a few trifling scratches we had incurred
no casualties whatever.</p>

<p>We now contrived to read Colonel
Macdonell's letter, and found that its
contents were not exactly what we had
persuaded ourselves they might be. The
Colonel had in fact desired me to return
to camp at Cawnpore, since the voluntary
retirement of the besiegers from the
threatened village had put an end to the
object of our expedition. However, to
use a homely phrase, there is no help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
for spilt milk. What we had done could
not be undone, so we decided to finish
the job in a workmanlike manner. To
this end we collected in heaps such property
as had been abandoned by the
enemy, and made bonfires of it. We also
destroyed by fire the neighbouring fortified
village which had harboured them,
and which it was most fortunate they were
not occupying when we arrived on the
scene; for it stood on high ground, and
we should have found it a hard nut to
crack. It was delightful to witness the
exuberant joy and vainglorious excitement
of our valiant matchlockmen; and
we all marched back in the best of spirits
to their home, now released from danger;
where we left them to enjoy the congratulations
of their womenfolk, while we
continued our journey back to Cawnpore&mdash;a
journey which turned out to be not
entirely without adventure.</p>

<p>We had, of course, secured a guide;
and for some few miles we marched
quietly on, when, judging that we could
easily find our way to the bridge over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the river by the position of the moon and
stars, Sandeman and I, taking an orderly
with us, left the party to follow
leisurely while we trotted on, for I
was anxious to report our success to
Sir John Inglis as speedily as possible;
but we had not gone more than a mile
or two when the sky became so thickly
overcast with clouds that not only was
the darkness intensified, but our beacons
were lost to view. We had to fall into
a walk, and very cautiously did we move;
for if we did unfortunately lose the proper
direction there was no certainty that
we might not fall in with a stray camp
of the enemy, who at that time infested
the district.</p>

<p>Presently we came in sight of a number
of twinkling lights, and held a debate
as to whether we should make for them
or not. We decided, however, that it
would be prudent to avoid them, so we
moved on in the opposite direction; and
after a while came across a small hamlet,
the watchful dogs of which all commenced
to bark in chorus. Into the village<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
we trotted at a smart pace, and
finding a man asleep on a "charpoy"
outside his hut, we roused him up,
and started him at a run out of the
place and into the open fields almost
before he had time to wake. We then
explained matters to him and offered
him a reward if he conducted us safely
to the bridge, with the alternative of
something quite different if he led us
into any trap.</p>

<p>We found that we had, after all, come
pretty straight, and were within a mile
or two of the river. At the bridge we
dismissed our guide with the promised
reward; and as dawn was now breaking
I went on to the Fort and sought the
General's quarters, not without trepidation;
for now that cool reflection had
time to sit in judgment on hot impulse,
I was not quite certain in what light our
proceedings would strike that redoubtable
officer, and what measure of allowance
he would make for the rather lame
excuse which I had to offer for not having
obeyed Colonel Macdonell's instructions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
I began to have grave doubts as
to whether he would swallow the match
story; and I heartily wished the interview
well over.</p>

<p>Sir John gravely listened to my report
and then proceeded to administer a
"wigging" which took all the conceit
out of me, and made me wish that I had
passed the previous night quietly in my
bed instead of in hunting rebels in the
jungle. My twitching face must have betrayed
the acuteness of my pain, for the
kind old General, laying his hand on my
shoulder, went on to say something to
the following effect:&mdash;"Don't be too
much upset about this. As your General
I was bound to rebuke you; for if
by any chance you had failed instead
of succeeded&mdash;if your party had lost
many lives and had been repulsed
into the bargain&mdash;you would have got
into serious trouble. As things have
turned out all has gone well, and you
have read these Pandies an excellent
lesson; and, in fact, I am not really at
heart displeased with you. Perhaps I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
may find you another job some day
soon."</p>

<p>If a condemned criminal were reprieved
at the scaffold, and were presented
with a handsome fortune into the bargain,
his feelings would be like mine at that
moment.</p>

<p>The promised job turned up not very
long afterwards.</p>

<p>I was directed to take my troop to a
point on the river several miles above
Cawnpore, and to establish a series
of picquets along its course for the purpose
of frustrating any attempt on the
part of the rebels to cross it. To assist
me in this duty a considerable body of
newly-raised semi-military police was
placed at my disposal, and I was told
that I could thoroughly rely on their
fidelity. As the length of front which I
had to guard stretched for many miles,
it was clear that my fifty sabres could do
little in the way of furnishing picquets.
I therefore made the following dispositions.
At favourable points along the
river I established a chain of small police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
posts, of about ten men, each under a
non-commissioned officer. Further inland,
on the lines of radii leading to my
own position, I placed three parties of my
own men, each consisting of a duffadar
and three sowars.</p>

<p>The rest of the detachment I kept together
at a central point a mile or two
from the river. The duties of the police
posts were to keep an incessant and vigilant
look-out, and to patrol the banks,
keeping touch with each other. In
the event of any suspicious movements
being observed on the opposite side of the
river, or of any attempt to cross it anywhere,
they were at once to communicate
with the nearest of my connecting
links, who would forward the information
to me; and I should thus be always
able to move the main body of my detachment
promptly to any threatened point.
Sandeman and I took it in turns to visit
the whole of the picquets&mdash;a duty which
entailed a ride of between twenty and
thirty miles. Having made these arrangements
I felt quite easy in my mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and waited on events. For some time,
however, no attempt at evading our vigilance
was made.</p>

<p>One morning I was informed that the
day was a sort of religious festival, on
which a certain rebel Raja, whose territory
was on the other side of the river,
was accustomed to come with a considerable
following to the bank for the purpose
of bathing in State; so Sandeman
and I betook ourselves to the police post
opposite which the "tamasha" was expected
to take place. At that point the
river was over a thousand yards wide,
far beyond the range of any weapons
possessed by us, with the exception of a
double-barrelled Lancaster oval smoothbore
of my own, whose powers I proposed
to try if I got the chance. I then
procured a couple of "charpoys," and
sat upon one while I rigged the other up
in front of it, placing it upright on one
of its sides in such a manner as to afford
an excellent and steady rest for my rifle.
Presently a couple of elephants with
howdahs on their backs, and surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by the usual rag-tag and bobtail which
in those days was inseparable from a
native magnate, emerged from some trees
on the other side of the river, and slowly
moved down to it with much waving
of "chowries" and beating of "tom-toms."</p>

<p>While the elephants were splashing in
the water I drew a bead on the biggest of
them, and fired. The bullet sped through
the air. Whether it hit the elephant or
not I cannot say; but the effect of its
arrival on the hitherto festive scene was
quite ludicrous. With one accord did
both elephants and their attendants turn
tail and scamper out of the water, and
up the bank into the shelter of the trees,
followed by a messenger from the other
barrel, which I despatched to hasten
their movements. The angry Raja now
replied to my insults with half-a-dozen
matchlock bullets, which fell harmlessly
into the water about half way across;
but he did not venture to resume his interrupted
bath, and very soon departed
<i>re infecta</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had gone I observed a couple
of large "country" boats lying under
the opposite bank, and offered a reward
to some villagers if they would go across
and get them, while I promised to drive
off with the rifle, whose wonderful range
they had just witnessed, any assailants
who might try to interfere with them.
A few manjees (boatmen) volunteered for
the job, and, by wading in shallow parts
and swimming in deeper ones, soon succeeded
in crossing the river, each of
them taking with him a long bamboo
pole. They took possession of the boats
without being molested, and had got
them half way across to our side when
a few matchlock men appeared, running
along beside the river and firing at them.
A couple of shots from the Lancaster,
however, very quickly persuaded them to
take themselves out of its reach; and
the boats were at length safely moored
under the protection of the police picquet.</p>

<p>It was not often that anything of
interest happened, and the days sometimes
passed rather monotonously. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
such occasions we would occasionally
beguile the time by getting one or other
of the native officers or men to relate their
adventures when fighting against "the
Sirkar," which many of them had done
at Moodkee, Chillianwalla, Sobraon, and
many another famous field, when the
brave troops of the Khalsa covered themselves
with glory, and earned from their
British antagonists the respect which all
soldiers entertain for "foemen worthy of
their steel."</p>

<p>One of the stories we thus heard fixed
itself on my memory, and I will endeavour
to reproduce it. The narrator, a
fine sturdy old Sikh gentleman, had been
persuaded to divulge the history of each
of the honourable scars which adorned
his body, with the exception of one which
crossed the bridge of his nose, and rather
spoiled its symmetry. On my asking
him whether that wound also was a memento
of war, he replied:&mdash;"Ah, Sahib!
I cannot tell you that story. You would
be angry with me." "Angry with you,"
I said, "why should I be angry if, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
suppose, you got the wound in honest
fight against us? Even if you killed the
man who inflicted it, that was his luck.
What is it to me? Come! Tell us all
about it." "Very well, Sahib, if you wish
it and will promise not to think the worse
of me, I will tell you. This is how it
was. You have heard of the great battle
at Chillianwalla, and you know how fierce
it was, and how stoutly the Sikhs
of the Khalsa fought that day. The
Sirkar Angrez<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> claims the victory; but
believe me, Sahib, we won that fight.
Did not the Jungie Lat Sahib<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> retire
from the field after the battle? Did not
we capture four of your guns and the
standards of three of your regiments?
Did not our horsemen overthrow the Gora
regiment and the Hindustani risala? Forgive
me, Sahib; but that is true; and if
Shere Singh had, next day, pushed his
advantage, and had boldly attacked the
shaken troops of the Sirkar, he must have
driven them clean out of the Punjab. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
that time I was&mdash;as I am now&mdash;a Sirdar;
and commanded a tolee<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of infantry of
my own people. At a certain moment of
the battle we found ourselves opposed at
close quarters to a British battalion,
which the fury of our fire had temporarily
checked: but if they hesitated, so did
we. In vain did I call on my men to
throw away their muskets, and rush,
sword in hand, to the attack. Neither
line dared advance; and neither would
retire; and there we knelt&mdash;for a dreadful
minute or two&mdash;pouring a frightful
hail of fire into each other at less than
a hundred yards. Both sides were actually
melting away under it. Such fearful
stress could not possibly last. One or
other line was certain to give way. Whichever
had the courage to rush forward
first was sure to win. Frantic were the
efforts of the officers of the Gora logue to
urge on their men; but in vain. Nothing
could get them to move. Suddenly
a young officer&mdash;so young&mdash;he was
but a smoothfaced, rosy-cheeked 'butcha'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>&mdash;got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
beside himself with excitement,
and waving over his head his
foolish little 'Regulation' blade, and
shouting 'Hurrah!' 'Hurrah!' he sprang
forward quite alone, and flew at me like
a madman; and almost before I could
see what he was doing, smote me across
the face. Poor boy! What could I do!
If I had not protected myself he would
have run me through the body with his
thin spit of a sword. So I had to smite
with my keen tulwar, and smite hard.
Next moment the Gora logue were upon
us, roaring like tigers, and we were
swept away before them. I remember
the rush, the clash of steel, and then nothing
more. I became <i>behosh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> When
I recovered my senses I found my head
bleeding, and a great lump on the top of
it; but no other wound except the cut on
my nose. I suppose I must have been
knocked down by a clubbed musket.
Night had fallen, and the field was
deserted except by the dead and dying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
and by gangs of plunderers. I stumbled
along for a <i>kos</i> or two, helped by some
of our own people whom I met on the
way; and then I found myself once more
in safety in the camp of Shere Singh.
You are not angry, Sahib! What could
I do? That boy would have killed me.
Every one must protect his own life."</p>

<p>Thus, with mingled grief and pride,
did we listen to the story of how "somebody's
darling" had died for his country's
honour.</p>

<h2>VII.<br />
DILKHOOSHA.</h2>

<p>While we lay in that camp keeping
guard over the river we were joined by another
young officer, and an incident occurred
to all three of us which was, to say
the least, mysterious. Our <i>bawarchi</i>, or
cook, was a Hindustani Musalman, and we
had every reason to be satisfied with his
culinary performances, till one morning
after breakfast, when both of my companions
who had sat down to that meal in
perfect health and with hearty appetites,
suffered from sudden nausea. As I was
not similarly affected, and had eaten the
same food with them, it did not occur to
us to suspect foul play. However, the
same thing happened more than once;
and at last, on one occasion, we were all
three violently sick almost immediately
after our morning repast. This was altogether
too suspicious: so, since a careful
inspection of our copper pots and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
pans showed that they were not in fault,
having been recently tinned, we came
to the conclusion that an attempt was
being made to poison us. Here was a
pretty state of affairs. If we dismissed
the <i>bawarchi</i> it was hopeless to think of
getting a substitute for him. We should
have had to starve, or trust to the hospitality
of our men for <i>chapatties</i>, such as
they themselves eat. Something had to
be done, however, and this is what we
did. A sentry was placed over the cook
during the time that he was engaged in
preparing our food, and he was ordered
to keep a sharp eye on that individual,
and to confiscate and bring to me any
condiment or other material which he
might propose to use that was not manifestly
harmless. These were not the
orders which the cook thought were given
to the sentry. He was, with much emphasis,
given to understand that the
Sikh who stood over him with a naked
<i>tulwar</i> had been directed to smite off his
head the moment he detected any suspicious
act; and as he knew that nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would please the grim disciple of Nanuk
better than to carry out such instructions
at the expense of a follower of the Arabian
Prophet, his lot at once ceased to
be a happy one. In fact, it was very
much the reverse, and it became quite
interesting to observe his proceedings
under the terror of the sword of Damocles,
which now hung over him. With
his sleeves carefully rolled up above his
elbows he squatted before the three small
sloping hollows in the ground with sides
and backs of stones, which formed his
kitchen range, and carried on his operations
in fear and trembling; for close
behind him stood the vigilant Sikh.
Whenever he glanced upwards he could
not avoid seeing the blue steel of the
sharp curved blade; and sometimes the
sentry, willing to amuse himself, would
frown wickedly, and peer into a <i>degchi</i>
as if he detected something wrong. At
such critical moments the wretched creature
would fairly grin with fright, as
with chattering teeth and supplicating
hands he resigned himself to the worst.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Then would the scowling Sikh growl out
a gruff <i>khabardar!</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and tell him to go
on with his work.</p>

<p>Our suspicions may have been unjust;
and the fact may have been only a coincidence.
Nevertheless it <i>was</i> a fact that
no more unpleasant symptoms attacked
any of us after our meals. On the whole,
we thought it fair to give the cook the
benefit of the doubt; and we seized the
first opportunity of dispensing with his
services.</p>

<p>We were beginning to flatter ourselves
that the watch on the Ganges kept by
our police auxiliaries was altogether too
stringent for the enterprise of the rebels;
but we were mistaken. It so happened
that one morning Sandeman and I rode
round the picquets together. For some
distance all was apparently quiet on the
river; and no report of anything unusual
was made by any of the police
posts. We had just arrived close to one
of them, when to our astonishment we
suddenly came upon the broad and fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
track of a considerable number of horses
and camels, clearly marked on the soft
wet soil, and leading inland from the
river straight past and immediately
under the high ground on which the
picquet was posted. We could hardly
believe our eyes. It was quite clear that
within a few hours a crossing had been
effected by some two or three hundred
mounted men, right under the noses of
the police, upon whose fidelity I had
been instructed to rely, and who had
carefully concealed the fact from me, if
they had not actively aided the rebels.
As soon as we struck the trail we followed
it across the sand to the point where
it emerged from the river, which at that
point was not very wide. We were
immediately greeted by a musket shot
from a man half-concealed among the
rushes on the opposite shore, and who
must have been a very indifferent marksman,
for he missed us. As he repeated
his performance in less time than he
could possibly have reloaded, we judged
that another musket must have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
handed to him by a confederate more
effectually hidden than himself; and as
we could not tell how many more might
be skulking in the thick cover, we considered
it expedient to retire from his
neighbourhood, after having replied to
his civilities with our revolvers, of course
ineffectually. We then went up to the
police post, and my first step was to
disarm and make prisoners of the whole
eleven men composing it; for their treachery
was self-evident, and demanded
no further enquiry.</p>

<p>There was a large village near by, and
in it we found a man suffering from a
gun-shot wound, which he said had been
wantonly inflicted by one of the rebels as
they passed the place early that morning.
This was corroborated by other inhabitants
of the village, so I considered myself
justified in desiring the chief local
representative of civil authority, who
styled himself a Tahsildar, to accompany
me to our camp, where I proposed to
take care of him till higher authority
should enquire into the propriety of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
conduct in not sending me word of what
had happened.</p>

<p>In the meantime I wrote with a pencil
on some leaves torn out of my note book
a short report to Sir John Inglis, commanding
at Cawnpore, in which I detailed
the circumstances proving the
treachery of the police, and suggested
that, if possible, they should be replaced
by a military force. I also stated that
since it was quite evident, both from the
appearance of the track and from the
testimony of the villagers, that the crossing
had been effected in the early dawn,
I considered it useless to make any
attempt to pursue the party of rebels,
who were said to be under the leadership
of the Bala Rao, and to be making
for Calpee, a place which, having
several hours' start, they must already
have nearly reached. I concluded by
asking for orders as to the disposal of
my prisoners; and sent off the despatch
at once to Cawnpore.</p>

<p>On our way to camp the Tahsildar met
with an accident, which, though serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
enough at the time, very possibly saved
his neck. He was riding a vicious country-bred
over whom he had very imperfect
control, and who backed into my
horse with the result of causing a violent
kicking match, at the end of which the
unfortunate man found himself on the
broad of his back on the ground with a
broken leg. I jumped off, and found
that both bones were broken half way
between the knee and the ankle. No
medical aid was available nearer than
Cawnpore; so I had to do the best I
could for him on the spot. I therefore
cut some stems of <i>bajra</i>, or some similar
crop which was growing close by; and
then, placing myself on the ground before
him and getting a purchase with
one foot against his body, I laid hold of
the injured limb by the ankle and
hauled on it with all my strength till I
had got the broken surfaces opposite
each other, where other hands placed
them in position. A portion of his turban
was now wrapped next the skin,
then a number of the sticks were laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
close together all round the leg, and
kept fast by cords; and we had rough
and ready splints, which answered their
purpose admirably. The patient was
now carried on a <i>charpoy</i> back to his own
house, where, after many days, he was
seen to by a medical officer who dressed
the limb in orthodox fashion, and who
declared the original operation had been
perfectly successful. I never heard that
this Tahsildar had been hanged, as I
have little doubt he would have been, if
compassion for his crippled condition
had not prevented me from pressing the
case against him. The ten police men
and their <i>Thanadar</i> were not so fortunate.
A special officer was sent out by
Sir John Inglis with full power to enquire
into and dispose of their case. To him I
explained the arrangements which I had
made for watching the river. I showed
him the track of the rebel party where it
passed within fifty yards of the picquet.
His investigation was over in an hour;
and at the end of it he sentenced the
whole eleven culprits to suffer death as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the reward of their treason, and hanged
them on one tree. He also informed me
that he would report that all my arrangements
had been judicious, and that no
blame could attach to me or my men.</p>

<p>No further attempt was made by the
rebels to cross the river; and indeed
none would have been practicable, for
General Walpole's Brigade had been
moved up the road from Cawnpore,
and effectually blocked the way. My
party was, however, not relieved; but
was allowed to remain where it was;
and, as the days rolled on, seemed likely
to become a fixture. We began to be
apprehensive that we might be overlooked
altogether, while preparations
were being made by Sir Colin Campbell
for the final advance upon Lucknow&mdash;a
prospect that was far from pleasing&mdash;but
it was not easy to see how it could
be averted. In this perplexity I sought
counsel from the Colonel of a regiment
which passed our camp on its way to
Cawnpore, and who, with some of his
officers, lunched with us. He advised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
me to write to Major-General Mansfield,
the Chief of the Staff, and bring our existence
to his notice, telling him how
long we had been detached from the
regiment, which was now at the Alumbagh,
and which would, if we were
allowed to rejoin it, obtain an accession
to its strength of three British officers
and fifty sabres. "You will certainly
get a wigging," said he, "but it is just
possible that your party is really overlooked,
and that your letter may effect
what you wish. At any rate, a bold
horseman must sometimes ride for a fall,
if he hopes to get over a stiff place."</p>

<p>I thankfully took his advice and acted
on it, and I certainly got the fall he had
anticipated; for in due course came an
oblong official letter from a staff officer
of the Chief of the Staff&mdash;not by any
means from the great man himself. In
that document I was very deservedly
rebuked for my presumption in having
written direct to the Chief of the Staff,
who, I was informed, was not in the
habit of corresponding with junior subalterns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as to the movements of their
detachments. This "awful warning" I
pinned conspicuously on the cloth wall
of my tent, where to my mingled amusement
and trepidation it was soon afterwards
seen by the very officer who had
written it. Whatever he may have
thought of my flippant treatment of his
effusion, he made no remarks, and shortly
thereafter my detachment was relieved
from its post and ordered back to Cawnpore.
There I had the good fortune
to be attached to the cavalry of Sir
Colin Campbell's army, and to march
with it towards Lucknow; and such
was my luck that, on the 2nd March
1858, when the Commander-in-Chief attacked
and captured the high ground
at Dilkhoosha dominating the City, I
actually found myself in command of the
advanced party of the advanced guard;
for that was the position of my troop
that day. Immediately in rear of it
was a squadron of the 9th Lancers,
followed by more cavalry and by horse
artillery. As we passed the Alumbagh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
where the head-quarters of our regiment
were encamped, I well remember how
delighted I felt to think that after all
we had stolen a march upon it, and
that&mdash;not to count that midnight affair
near Unao&mdash;our troop was to have the
honour of being the first to go into
action. Well also do I remember the
wistful look on the face of my gallant
commanding officer, the late Captain
Wale, as he watched us pass, and wished
us good luck. We all knew that a
fight was before us; and it did seem
uncommonly hard on the regiment that,
after having so long been posted at the
very front, it should at the last moment
be left, "<i>planté la</i>," by a detachment
which had, so to speak, sneaked up from
the rear.</p>

<p>When the head of the column had got
about midway between the Alumbagh
and Dilkhoosha a halt was sounded; and
we took the opportunity of making a
rapid breakfast of such eatables as we
had stowed away in our holsters. During
this period a disagreeable drizzling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
shower of rain did what it could to damp
our spirits as well as our bodies; but
when we again moved on it had ceased;
having laid the dust for us, and given us
a cool, pleasant day fit for a review.</p>

<p>Cautiously and steadily we felt our
way, covered by half the troop in extended
order, commanded by Lieutenant
Sandeman, who summarily brushed out
of our road sundry small bodies of hostile
horsemen whom he encountered. My
half troop was in support, and when the
skirmishing began we pushed on and
joined in the fun. Through orchards and
plantations with occasional open fields
an intermittent series of little fights was
kept up as we continued our advance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as we emerged from a
grove of trees on to an open plain, a distant
puff of smoke followed by a loud report
and then by the well-known hoarse
hiss of a round shot as it tore through
the air above us, gave unmistakable notice
that the ball had begun. Another
shot fell short, hit the ground in front of
us, and then ricoched over our heads to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the rear. Another and another in quick
succession passed harmlessly. While
this was going on I had instinctively
taken ground to the right to make room
for the troops which I knew would be
pushed forward. The squadron of the
9th Lancers followed my example&mdash;a
troop of horse artillery thundered up
from the rear&mdash;more cavalry galloped out
to the left of the guns&mdash;and, like magic,
a line was formed to the front, the guns
in the centre, with cavalry on both flanks.
A trumpet sounded the "advance," and
the "gallop," and away we swept over
the plain, straight for the enemy's position,
under a furious fire, too furious and
rapid, fortunately, to do us much mischief.
One round shot smote a man of
the 9th Lancers full in the face. His
head disappeared into space. In a few
moments we were within a hundred yards
of the enemy, still frantically blazing
away at us. Here we came to a halt;
and our own guns, with the astonishing
swiftness which is the admiration of all
other branches of the army, unlimbered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and came into action. Very different
was their practice from that of the rebel
artillery. Equally rapid, but with calm
regularity, working like parts of a perfect
machine, gun after gun, carefully
and accurately laid, pounded away at
the opposing battery, and with almost
instantaneously overpowering effect. A
very few rounds, and the fire of the
enemy slackened away, and soon nearly
ceased altogether.</p>

<p>While this artillery duel was going on
I had a good opportunity of observing
the effect of what is popularly known as
"blue funk" on a young recruit. He
was in the rear rank; and while the
excitement of galloping to the front lasted,
had kept his place among his comrades;
but to sit still within a hundred
yards of guns belching out smoke and
noise and round shot was more than his
nerves were equal to; and he began&mdash;half
unconsciously, I daresay&mdash;to pull on his
horse's head and gradually back him out
of the ranks. This would never do! Example
is catching, so I galloped round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
behind him and used language calculated
to bring him to his senses, but without
effect. With his mouth half-open
and his eyes starting out of his head he
continued to stare at the terrifying guns,
greeting each explosion with a horrified
little groan; and all the time he kept
backing his horse on to me. I was obliged
to put an end to this. In another
moment he would have bolted and disgraced
us all&mdash;possibly infected some of
his comrades with his own panic. For the
last time I shouted that I would run my
sword into him if he did not "dress up."
He took no heed; and I lunged at him
with all my force. His luck saved him.
He had a small buffalo-hide buckler
hanging from his left shoulder; and
instinctively he twisted half round and
caught the point of my sword in it, and
there it stuck. The more I pulled and the
worse language I used, the less would it
come out; and I am afraid the string of
words with which I expressed my disgust
must have been far from discreetly chosen,
when behind me a voice exclaimed:&mdash;"Who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
commands this party?" Looking
round, the unfortunate recruit's panic
was nothing to what mine became, when
I saw the stern face of the Commander-in-Chief,
Sir Colin Campbell. Caught
in the act of trying to kill one of my own
men, visions of a court-martial&mdash;of the
loss of my commission&mdash;swam before me,
as with one despairing effort I wrenched
the blade out of the buckler, and, dropping
its point to the Chief, stammered
out my defence. "I really couldn't help
it, Sir? He was showing the white feather.
I was afraid he would bolt." To
my intense relief the grim features relaxed
into a smile. "Never mind," said Sir
Colin, "you were quite right. They are
trying to carry off some of their guns to
the right front. Gallop after them and
catch them." It may be imagined I lost
no time in carrying out that order and
placing as great a distance as possible
between me and His Excellency. My
young recruit came too, and afterwards
behaved very well. He turned out a
good soldier after that "baptism of fire."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
A hard gallop soon brought us up with
the flying enemy, who were "pounded"
by a big ditch, where they abandoned
the guns and took to their heels, but too
late to save themselves. Here I had rather
a narrow escape from abruptly ending
my military experiences. Two
"Pandies," whom I was pursuing, suddenly
turned round and stood at bay, and
almost simultaneously lashed at me with
their <i>tulwars</i> as I charged between them.
The man on the right brought his sword
down on my head, fortunately protected
by a thick "puggari," many folds of
which it divided, and then glanced down
on to my horse's shoulder, inflicting a
long and deep wound. At the same
moment I delivered a swinging cut on
his own cranium which was covered by
a small skull cup. That settled him
effectually; but I had barely time to
throw my sword round and receive on it
a sweeping blow from the fellow on my
left, which partially overpowered my
guard and landed on my ribs, luckily
much diminished in force; so that I escaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
with a trifling flesh wound. He
did not get another chance; for I dropped
the point of my blade and ran him
through the body. I was well out of
that scrimmage, but my unlucky horse
was quite disabled; so I had to dismount
and entrust him to the care of one of my
men, whose animal I borrowed for the
rest of the day; and a very poor exchange
I found it, both as regards charger and
saddle.</p>

<p>I feel I must interrupt my narrative to
beg the reader's indulgence for the introduction
of descriptions of some of the
adventures which happened to me personally.
I trust he may believe that it
is not due to any foolish desire to pose
before him; nor to a wish, in the words
of Mr. Wardle's fat boy, "to make his
flesh creep;" but simply because I want
to make these sketches as graphic as I
can; and it seems to me that the effect
would be to wash the colour out of them
if I were to divest them of every touch of
personal interest. In campaigns like
those of the Mutiny in which our irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
cavalry was so freely used and played so
important a part, hand-to-hand conflict
was much more frequent than in ordinary
wars. In fact, every officer of that
branch had numberless opportunities of
testing his skill at arms; for skirmishes
were often of almost daily occurrence;
and in each skirmish he carried his life
literally at the point of his sword. To
resume: A few minutes afterwards another
adventure of a "touch and go"
nature befell me. In a <i>mêlée</i> a brother
officer had singled out a rebel foot soldier,
and was hotly striving to cut him down,
but his antagonist with bayonet fixed
kept him at bay, and had just brought
his musket to his shoulder to fire, when
most luckily in the very nick of time I
saw what was going on, and charged the
Pandy, who, disconcerted by the sudden
attack, hurriedly attempted to shift his
aim on to me, but ineffectually. As he
pulled the trigger his bullet sped harmlessly
past my face, while I brought the
edge of my sword down on his skull with
such good will that it clave in two, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he fell dead. That fortunate interference
in an unequally matched <i>combat à deux</i>
probably saved from an untimely ending
a life which has since proved of the
highest value and usefulness, while it
preserved to me a dear comrade and lifelong
friend. Among the most cherished
of my possessions is the sword which he
gave me as a memento of the affair.</p>

<p>The resistance offered by the enemy
to Sir Colin's advance was not sufficiently
serious to check it; and in fact no
deployment of his troops was necessary.
The heads of his columns steadily moved
forward and gradually approached the
position on the high ground which he
had decided to occupy as affording the
best point from which to carry out his
plans for the subjugation of Lucknow.</p>

<p>While my troop was moving up a slope
close to the Dilkhoosha we were suddenly
gratified by the sight of a body of
horse, about forty or fifty strong, which
appeared in line on the crest of it coming
towards us at a walk. The French-grey
uniforms of this squad left no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
as to its belonging to one of the old
regular regiments; and my hopes rose
high that now we were to have an
opportunity of wiping out some of the
disgrace which their treason had brought
upon all who had belonged to their
branch of the service of Old John Company:
but the cowards declined to give
us the chance.</p>

<p>"Threes about" they went the moment
they saw us, and immediately disappeared,
hidden from us by the rising ground.
It may be imagined that we lost no time
in driving in our spurs and galloping
after them: but when we arrived at the
top of the slope they had made such
good use of their horses' legs that they
were already far away, pelting along, in
clouds of dust, over the plain below, and
heading for a ford across the Goomti
river, into which they presently plunged.
The hurry they were in was good to see,
as was their complete indifference to any
pretence at keeping any sort of formation.
Evidently they realised that this
was no time to be hampered by pedantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
adherence to "drill." Such mechanical
regularity of movement might be all
very well for the parade-ground; but in
real soldiering, such as this, "individual
initiative" must take its place. In they
went, by twos and threes, just as they
came to the ford, and floundered across:
but at this juncture a couple of guns of
ours opened on them, and made their
passage very uncomfortable; for those
who were not knocked out of their saddles
got drenched by the splash of the
projectiles. Once across, they continued
their career at best speed for another mile
or two before drawing rein. On the
whole, I do not think they enjoyed that
morning's ride very much.</p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
LUCKNOW.</h2>


<p>A story is told of the behaviour of a
company of Native Infantry on the establishment
of a sister Presidency, which I
may be pardoned for reproducing here,
since it may be new to some of my
readers.</p>

<p>The company in question was performing
an uncommonly rapid movement to
the rear, to get away from an undesirable
neighbourhood, when a British
officer, who tried to stop the stampede,
roared after it Halt! Halt! Halt! At
this a fat old Subadar, who was doing his
best to keep up with his command, indignantly
spluttered out as he scuttled along,
puffing and blowing&mdash;"Kaun guddha
halt bolta hai? Yih halt ka wakt nahin
hai!" "What ass says halt! This is no
time to halt." Down in Madras that
story, if known, is doubtless put to the
credit of a Bengal regiment, and probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
with equal truth. <i>Si non e vero e ben
trovato</i>&mdash;which must be my excuse for repeating
it.</p>

<p>During this morning's work I happened
to come across a British soldier&mdash;I
think of the 9th Lancers&mdash;who had been
wounded, but not very seriously, though
sufficiently to cripple him. He was lying
patiently under a tree waiting for the
hospital establishment to come up and
find him; and when I asked if I could do
anything for him, he said he was suffering
agonies from thirst, and would give anything
for a drink of water. "Would you
prefer beer?" I asked. "Oh, Sir," he
replied, "don't make game of me." His
face was delightful to see when I lugged
out of one of my holsters a pint bottle
of "Bass" which I had stowed in it
according to my invariable practice, and
knocked off its head by sliding my
sword against it. The grateful fellow
tried hard to make me drink half of
it; but I could not resist the temptation
of watching him swallow it to the
last drop. When I presented him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
a better Manilla cheroot than he had
probably ever smoked in his life before,
he began, I really believe, to think he was
dreaming, and that such strange luck
could not be real.</p>

<p>Before the evening of the next day a
huge canvas city had sprung up in rear
of the Dilkhoosha Palace. "The Cabul
scale equipment" had not been invented
in those days; and even subalterns
luxuriated in large, old-fashioned hill
tents, ten or twelve feet square, while the
British soldiers were lodged in roomy-double-poled
affairs; so that an encampment
took up a deal more room than
would now be required. No wonder that
Sir Colin's army of fighting men was
hampered by a much larger one of
helpless camp-followers, of which Dr.
Russell, the famous war correspondent,
thus wrote:&mdash;"Who really can bring
before his mind's eye a train of baggage
animals twenty-five miles long, a string
of sixteen thousand camels, a siege-train
park covering a space of four hundred
by four hundred yards, with twelve thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
oxen attached to it, and a following
of sixty thousand non-combatants."</p>

<p>Sir Colin Campbell lost no time in
pushing on the siege, for it practically
began on the 2nd March, the day that
he reached the Dilkhoosha. I well remember
watching with admiration the
brilliant performance of the Naval Brigade,
the blue jackets of the <i>Shannon</i>,
under the heroic Captain Peel, as they
pushed forward to a position in front
of the Palace, where, on the open ground
sloping downwards towards the Martinière,
without a vestige of cover, they
planted their guns, and commenced a
fierce reply to the cannonade of the rebels
from the huge defensive earthworks
which they had thrown up on the south-east
of the City. Our gallant old Chief
was far too wise, however, to throw his
whole weight against these terrible lines
of defence till he had discounted their
value by the simple yet effective device
of a turning movement, that old-established
favourite with all great commanders.
To carry out this design Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
James Outram was sent across the
Goomti, near Bibiapore, on the 6th of
March, with a very strong force of all
arms, which fought its way up the left
bank of the river, driving the enemy
before it, till, on the 9th, it had reached
a position whence it successfully enfiladed
the rebel lines of defence.</p>

<p>Now was Sir Colin able to advance
without the enormous sacrifice of life
which otherwise would have been inevitable.
That day the Black Watch stormed
the Martinière at the point of the bayonet
without firing a shot. The day
after, "Banks' House" was seized and
promptly fortified; and from this coign
of vantage, step by step, deliberately and
irresistibly, did our Engineers and Artillery
sap and breach the way for our infantry
through block after block of buildings,
till by the 21st of March every
palace, mosque and walled enclosure in
Lucknow had been carried, and the entire
City was in our hands.</p>

<p>While this was being accomplished,
my regiment had formed part of a Brigade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
under Brigadier W. Campbell,
which marched round the City, past the
Alumbagh, to a position opposite the
Moosabagh, with the view of cutting
off the escape of the rebels when
they should be driven out of the town by
the bayonets of the Infantry. During
this movement we met with desultory
opposition, and lost several lives; but
we came across no large masses of the
enemy; and there can be no doubt that
thousands of them slipped through our
fingers and effected their escape, to re-unite
later on and prolong into the
rapidly approaching "hot weather" a
struggle which, if we had been more
fortunate, would have been ended there
and then. At the same time, in justice
to Brigadier Campbell, it must be remembered
that the semi-circle traversed
by him was of great extent&mdash;probably
more than thirty miles&mdash;and it needs no
great effort of imagination to conceive
how difficult was the task of preventing,
with a small Brigade of Cavalry and
Horse Artillery, so long a line from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
penetrated by bodies of fugitives at one
point or another, even by day, still more
under cover of night.</p>

<p>I was much struck during this march
by an instance of heroism on the part
of two village matchlockmen which deserves
record, and which, if it had been
performed by natives of a European
country in defence of their homes, would
have been sung by poets in patriotic
ballads, and would have earned for the
brave actors an immortality of applause.</p>

<p>The scouts of the advanced guard
were approaching a very broad deep
"nullah" which I had been ordered to
reconnoitre with the view of finding a
practicable way across it for our guns.
On the level plain behind us, under the
bright sun, moved slowly onwards the
strong body of Cavalry, of which we were
merely the forerunners. Beyond the
"nullah," nestled among its fields and
mango groves a small village, from
which emerged two tall peasants, clad in
their usual white cotton working clothes,
each of them carrying a matchlock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>With the utmost deliberation these
two men approached the ravine, and,
lying down in a sheltered hollow, opened
fire on us. They could have been
under no illusions as to their chances of
escape. They saw that they were two
against two thousand. They knew that
their puny effort to stop us was hopeless;
but yet they did all they could, and
devoted themselves to death in defence
of the brown mud walls which held
their household gods. In vain we
shouted to them that we did not intend to
harm their village&mdash;that we were going
past it, and would not enter it. They
evidently did not believe us; and continued
to load and fire with as much expedition
as their long, clumsy, tinder-locks
allowed them. They were sure to hit
some of us in time: so we were obliged
to scatter and cross the nullah at different
points, and "fall upon them with
the edge of the sword."</p>

<p>When the final great eruption of
the rebels from the Moosabagh took
place on the 21st March, Brigadier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Campbell was undoubtedly caught napping.
It was not till many thousands
of the enemy had streamed out and had
already crossed miles of country that
the Brigade was slipped in pursuit. The
first to get under way were two troops of
the 1st Sikh Irregulars under Captain
the Hon'ble Hugh Chichester, with
whom Lieutenant Sandeman and I were
sent. We galloped for several miles
without coming across more than a few
scattered groups, and were beginning to
think that the reported flight of the
"Pandies" was a false alarm, when
suddenly the numbers of the fugitives
began to increase, and presently we were
in the thick of them. With the exception
of a few men of rank on elephants, they
were all on foot. Their horsemen had got
clean away from us. Our progress now became
less rapid, for we were engaged in a
series of "scrimmages," and before long
the rest of the regiment came up, as did
the 7th Hussars and the Military Train.</p>

<p>Late as we were in catching up the
rebels, we yet inflicted great slaughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
on them, with hardly any damage to ourselves
till late in the day, almost at the
end of the pursuit, when our regiment
suffered an irreparable loss, which will
be presently narrated.</p>

<p>We had, as usual in similar affairs, got
broken up into small groups and single
individuals, when I noticed on my left
front a sturdy rascal, seemingly, from his
dress, a dismounted cavalry soldier, stalking
along, with a musket on his shoulder,
sullenly disdaining to run. Him I marked
for my prey and dashed after: but
when I got within a few yards of him he
faced about and covered me with his
musket, expressing himself at the same
time in very forcible terms of abuse
and defiance. This uncompromising
attitude on his part made me think it
would be more prudent to shoot than to
attempt to sabre him: so I wheeled off
to the left and circled round him to the
right, returned my sword, and drew my
revolver. All this time he held his ground,
slowly turning on his pivot, and never
ceasing to follow my movements with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
aim; but he reserved his fire, for no doubt
he coolly reflected that, if he missed me,
he would be at my mercy. Every barrel
of my revolver did I empty at him,
and every time without hitting him. Between
his legs&mdash;under his arms&mdash;past his
head&mdash;flew my bullets, till the whole six
were expended. Nothing remained but
to gallop away to a safe distance, re-load,
and renew the experiment, or else to trust
to my sword and charge him. I dare
say that if there had been no witnesses
about I would have chosen the former
alternative: but there were many men of
the regiment close by, and sheer shame
prevented me; so I returned the useless
pistol, drew my sword, and with my
heart in my mouth went straight at him
at full speed. As I raised my arm to
smite, he pulled the trigger. Bending
myself half out of the saddle on the near
side I escaped the bullet, and delivered
on his head with all my force a cut which
dropped him to the ground. Though
mortally wounded he was not dead; and
he fumbled in his <i>cummerbund</i> for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
revolver which was sticking out of it; so I
dismounted, and as he&mdash;dazed and blinded&mdash;pulled
the pistol out of his waist-cloth,
I seized his wrist and directed his
aim harmlessly into the air. I then
wrenched the weapon from his grasp and
used another barrel of it to put him out
of his pain. That revolver was subsequently
identified as having belonged to
an officer named Thackwell, if my memory
serves me right, who had been killed
in the City a few days previously when
separated from his comrades.</p>

<p>Some little time after this incident I
saw a small group of fugitives far away
on our left, making for a walled village,
and it occurred to me to try a long shot
at them with my Lancaster rifle, which
was always carried by my orderly on a
belt slung over his shoulder; so I turned
round and asked for it, but the orderly
was not to be seen, and some of the
other men said:&mdash;"Don't you know,
Sahib, that your orderly has been killed?"
"Killed!" I exclaimed. "When? Has
he not been following me all along?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Then, for the first time, I learned that
the faithful fellow, who must have been
close at my heels when I charged the
sepoy, but of whose presence in my excitement
I had been totally oblivious,
had been hit in the chest by the bullet
which I had so narrowly escaped and
had been seen to fall. I could not then
return to the fatal spot, but I sent a
couple of men back at once to find the
poor fellow, and, if he should be still alive,
to get a doolie and carry him to the
hospital tent in camp.</p>

<p>For several miles we kept up the pursuit
till we had apparently exhausted
the lead&mdash;to use a miner's term&mdash;on which
we had struck. We were about to give
up the chase, when, from the far side of
a ravine, a solitary fugitive fired his musket
at a group of our officers. He must
have aimed at the one who, from his full
brown beard and apparent age, seemed to
him the most important and most likely
to be the commander. That shot cost us
the life of our brave Commanding Officer.
The gallant Captain Wale fell, mortally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
wounded by two slugs, one of which
passed through his beard into his throat,
the other into his mouth. He was instantly
avenged, for, as the rebel sepoy
turned to fly, he also fell dead, hit in the
spine by a bullet from the revolver of
Captain Chichester.</p>

<p>In a few minutes, to the deep grief of
his officers and men, by whom he was
loved as few Commanding Officers are
ever loved, poor Wale breathed his
last. A doolie was sent for from the
rear, his body placed in it and reverently
carried back to camp. Sick at heart,
I now sought the place where my unfortunate
orderly had met his fate. My
worst fears were realized. He was dead.
His body had not been disturbed by the
men whom I had sent to find him, and
he was lying on his back, the rifle underneath
him, with a hole through the
leather sling just where it crossed over
the heart. Close by lay the corpse of the
sepoy.</p>

<p>Very sad was our return to camp that
day. I had no sooner placed before my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
tent the doolie in which was the body of
my poor orderly than his father, a fine
old Sikh, who also was a sowar in the
regiment, and who, having remained in
camp on that occasion, was in complete
ignorance of our losses, came up to me
with a smile on his handsome old face to
ask after his son. My heart was too full
to speak. I could only point to the doolie,
the curtains of which were closed. Lifting
one of them up, he looked in and
knew his bereavement. The proud old
soldier set his face hard, drew himself
up, saluted me, and said:&mdash;"My son's
'nokri' (service) is over. Let me take
his place. I will be your orderly now,
Sahib." I am not ashamed to say that
this touching act of simple, unaffected
Spartan fortitude completely unmanned
me.</p>

<p>The remains of the brave Captain Wale
rest in the Moosabagh, a walled garden
which formerly belonged to the Nawabs
of Oudh, but which was confiscated from
Wajid Ali, the last of that race, by the
British Government. The massive walls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and towers and gateways of the erst
Royal pleasance are now rapidly crumbling
into ruins. The huge garden which
once bloomed within them is now a
wilderness of thorns and jungle trees,
interspersed with ill-kept patches of cultivation.
Everything speaks of decay
and neglect, except the tomb itself and
its little walled enclosure, which I was
glad to find on the 4th of January,
1891 in perfect repair, and shewing evident
signs of careful attention on the part
of the district authorities. About a furlong
beyond the fourth milestone on the
Lucknow-Bareilly road, and about a mile
to the right, is the Moosabagh, in which,
under the spreading arms of a fine old
mango tree, will be found the solitary
tomb, bearing on it the following inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sacred to the memory of Captain F. Wale, who
raised and commanded the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry.
Killed in action at Lucknow on the 1st March, 1858.
This monument is erected by Captain L. B. Jones,
Acting Commandant of the 1st Sikh Irregular Cavalry,
as a token of regard for this officer, whom he admired
both as a friend and soldier. Captain Wale lived and
died a Christian Soldier."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>The original designation of the 1st
Sikh Irregular Cavalry has disappeared
from the <i>Army List</i>. It is now known as
the 11th (Prince of Wales' Own) Bengal
Lancers. While that distinguished regiment
continues to exist&mdash;and may that
be as long as the British Empire itself!&mdash;will
be imperishably associated with
its annals the first name inscribed on its
muster-roll, that of its Founder and first
Commander, the gallant Captain Wale.</p>

<h2>IX.<br />
A HERO'S DEATH.</h2>


<p>Not long after following to the grave
the remains of my beloved Commanding
Officer, I was so unfortunate as to be
prostrated by a severe attack of remittent
fever, and to be sent on six months'
sick leave to the hills.</p>

<p>Before closing these brief memoirs
I must fulfil my promise of relating how
my dear comrade and former Commanding
Officer, Captain Sanford, lost his life.</p>

<p>He had succeeded the gallant Younghusband,
who had been killed shortly
before at Futtehgarh, in the command of
a detachment of the 5th Punjab Cavalry,
which formed part of the Mounted Brigade
under Sir Hope Grant, and was attached
to Sir James Outram's force during
the operations in March, 1858 on the
left bank of the Goomti. On the 10th of
March, while the Cavalry Brigade was
returning from a reconnaissance, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fired on by a small group of rebels. Sir
Hope Grant ordered Captain Sanford to
attack these men; but before he could
overtake them they had reached the
shelter of a village which Sanford decided
to reconnoitre personally before
taking his men into it. He therefore
dismounted them and left them outside,
while he penetrated into the place without
a single companion. He climbed
on to the flat roof of a house, and
moved forward to a low wall which
separated it from the roof of the next
house. Over that wall he must have
vaulted, when he found himself confronted
by the loopholes of a higher building
within a few yards of him. From
these loopholes a volley flashed, and he
fell, struck by a bullet in the forehead.
Thus ended a life which till that moment
had seemed a charmed one. Always
utterly reckless of his own safety, while
considerate of others to a fault&mdash;a magnificent
horseman&mdash;a finished master of
swordsmanship&mdash;he had hitherto triumphantly
and gaily carried his life through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
a hundred perils. His first wound was
his last. The day before he fell he had
read in the <i>Gazette</i> the announcement of
his promotion to a brevet majority for
distinguished service before Delhi: and
doubtless his heart was full of soldierly
pride and of hope of yet more brilliant
honour when the fatal bullet suddenly
and for ever stilled it.</p>

<p>As he did not return, the worst was
feared; and a gallant young officer volunteered
to go in search of him. With
him went two of Sanford's men. They
followed the route which he had taken,
but had no sooner got on to the top of
the house than another volley laid low
both the sowars, killing one and wounding
the other. The officer immediately
dragged the wounded man off the house,
and then returned and brought away the
body of his comrade. Once more he
started on his heroic errand, accompanied
by two fresh volunteers. During
the previous brief episode he had noticed
that the loopholes in the high building
were so cut that the muzzles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
muskets of its occupants could not be
depressed at a very acute angle. He now
left his two men at the foot of the wall
of the house, and himself climbed on to
the roof. Throwing himself flat on his
stomach, he crawled up to the low partition-wall
beyond which lay Captain
Sanford's body. As he vaulted over
this and again threw himself flat, a
volley was fired, but missed him. His
surmise proved to have been correct.
While he lay prone the muskets of the
rebels could not be depressed so as to
hit him: so he crept up to the body,
and, dragging it with him, reached the
low wall. Exerting all his strength, he
hoisted it over, and fell with it on the
other side, escaping unscathed from the
hurried fusillade which pursued him.
In a few seconds he was once more in
safety with his sacred burden. Then
ensued a smart little fight. The village
was stormed, and every one of the rebels
in it was killed. The young hero whose
story I have told was recommended by
Sir Hope Grant for the Victoria Cross,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
which I have no doubt my readers will
agree with me in thinking he had well
earned, but&mdash;it was not awarded to
him.</p>

<p>Though I was not an eye-witness of the
events above described, and cannot
therefore vouch from personal knowledge
for the strict accuracy of all the details,
the reader may perfectly rely on the main
correctness of the relation: for I have
repeated it as it was told to me at the
time; and, deeply interested as I was in
all that pertained to the fate of so dear a
friend as was Sanford to me, the story
burnt itself into my memory. Moreover,
I have lately sought and obtained satisfactory
confirmation of it.</p>

<p>About a hundred and fifty yards to
the right of the Lucknow-Fyzabad road,
and about a hundred yards beyond the
bridge where that road crosses the Gokral
nullah, stands an obelisk in a small
walled enclosure. On a white marble
tablet let in to the obelisk is the following
inscription:&mdash;"Beneath this monument
rest the mortal remains of Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Sanford, late Captain of the 3rd Bengal
Light Cavalry, who, when gallantly
leading a body of dismounted Punjab
Cavalry in an assault on a fortified place
near Lucknow, on the 10th March, 1858,
met a soldier's death."</p>

<p>"Stranger: Respect the lonely resting-place
of the brave!"</p>

<p>A slab on the wall of the enclosure
records that it was consecrated by the
Right Reverend Ralph, Bishop of Calcutta,
on the 17th of January, 1878.</p>

<p>Truely, a lonely resting-place for the
ashes of a hero. A solitary tree marks
the spot on the bare brown plain, the
desolate surface of which is scored by
small ravines trending down to the
Gokral nullah. Not far off is a village,
probably the one where the gallant
Sanford fell. A broad cultivated valley,
through which the tortuous Goomti river
rolls, like a huge snake, its sluggish
folds, fills, to the south, the foreground
of the landscape. Beyond the fields,
through the distant haze, rise, embosomed
among groves of trees, the domes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
minarets of Lucknow&mdash;a beautiful and
placid scene&mdash;realising the Poet's vision
of a "haunt of ancient peace."</p>

<p>Such are now the surroundings of the
sacred spot where, nearly thirty-three
years ago, was laid to rest, while the
air was thick with the smoke of battle,
all that could die of the heroic Charles
Sanford.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
